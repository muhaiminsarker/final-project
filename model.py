        "Listed as Critically Endangered because the extent of occurrence is less than 100 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;area of occupancy is less than 10 km<sup>2</sup>, all individuals are known from a single location, and the quality of its habitat is declining due largely to invasive exotic grasses. <br> <br/>This species is endemic to Australia, where it formerly ranged from Deniliquin in south-central New South Wales north to Mount Douglas in central Queensland. It is currently restricted to Epping Forest National Park, 120 km north-west of Clermont in central Queensland (Horsup and Johnson 2008). The species' range at Epping Forest National Park covers 500 ha, or less than one sixth of the park (Horsup 2004, Horsup and Johnson 2008). Fossils of this species have been found as far south as Victoria. <br/> This species is listed as a threatened species by Queensland and by Australian law. Its entire range is within the Epping Forest National Park. The Recovery Plan for this species is in its third edition (see Horsup 2004). <br> <br/>The following management actions are underway or planned:<br/><br/>1) Control threats and manage habitat. Predator control – A 20-km predator fence was built in 2002 to prevent a repeat of dingo predation that killed at least 15 wombats in 2000. Monitor and control competitors – The Eastern Grey Kangaroo is the major competitor for food and its numbers are being monitored. Habitat management – Introduced buffel grass is regularly slashed to promote green growth and native species. Fire management – Annual burns are undertaken to reduce fuel loads and promote plant diversity. Supplementary feed and water provisioning – Feed and water stations are now being used by wombats, particularly in dry times (Treby <em>et al.</em> 2007). Permanent management presence on Epping Forest National Park – A volunteer caretaker program ensures twice daily monitoring of the dingo fence.<br/><br/>2) Accurately monitoring wombats. Population censuses – Three censuses each year minimize disturbance and maximize the accuracy of the result and involve collecting wombat hair on sticky tape to extract DNA (see Banks <em>et al.</em> 2003). Burrow monitoring – This is undertaken every six months and monitors activity levels at burrows as an early warning system. Trapping – This was the major means of censusing prior to development of the DNA technique and is now only undertaken when necessary (e.g., to attach radio-collars).<br/><br/>3) Translocation. Locate sites for the establishment of future Northern Hairy-nosed Wombat colonies and develop translocation techniques on Epping Forest National Park.<br/><br/>4) Develop captive techniques on other wombat species. Southern Hairy-nosed Wombats are being used to improve wombat captive breeding and reproductive monitoring techniques. There are no Northern Hairy-nosed Wombats in captivity.<br/><br/>5) Monitor wombat biology and ecology. This includes ongoing studies of diet, reproduction, habitat utilization, behaviour, and burrow architecture.<br/><br/>6) Manage the recovery team. A full-time Recovery Manager is responsible for coordinating and implementing the Recovery Plan, making all relevant information available to recovery personnel, obtaining funding for the Recovery Plan, and undertaking research and monitoring.<br/><br/>This species is listed on CITES Appendix I."
        , "Listed as Extinct because the last confirmed records were in 1924 (Australasian Mammal Assessment Workshop 2008). Despite extensive searching in the 1970s, no Toolache Wallabies were located and there have been no confirmed reports since (Smith and Robinson 2008). There is a report from 1943 (Flannery and Schouten 2001) and reports from the 1950s to the 1970s (Robinson and Young 1983). <br> <br/><p>The Toolache Wallaby was apparently common within a restricted range. By 1910, populations had been reduced to a number of scattered colonies in the area enclosed by Robe, Kingston and Beachport on the South Australian coast, and Naracoorte and Penola further to the east, near Mt Gambier. By 1924 only one small group was known to survive on Konetta Station, about halfway between Robe and Penola. An attempt was made to transfer some of the population to a sanctuary on Kangaroo Island, but this failed. The last known survivor died in captivity in Robe in 1939 (Flannery and Kendall 1990).</p>The Toolache Wallaby occupied open country. Its preferred habitat was grassland at the edge of woodlands of Brown Stringybark <em>Eucalyptus baxteri</em> with heathy understorey. Such areas were flat or gently undulating, becoming swampy in winter with depressions filled by a matted growth of Black Rush (Chaffy Saw-sedge) <em>Gahnia filum</em> or among tussocks of tall coarse Cutting Grass <em>Gahnia trifida</em> and Kangaroo Grass <em>Themeda</em> sp. Small areas of slightly higher ground carried sparse stands of Drooping She-oak <em>Allocasuarina verticillata</em>, which were used for shelter. Toolache Wallabies had an unusual gait, but were capable of high speed for long periods (Robinson and Young 1983)."
        , "Listed as Endangered as standardized surveys indicate that the global Tasmanian Devil population has declined by more than 60% in the last 10 years (Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006, McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). Research indicates that an invariably fatal infectious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD), is responsible for the decline. DFTD currently occurs across the majority (estimated 60%) of the geographic range of the devil and continues to spread at variable rates (depending on location) in the range of 7-50 km/y (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). Mark-recapture data from the most intensively studied population at Freycinet National Park estimated a decline in total population size of 30% in the first 3 years after disease arrival, with an annual decline in the adult (2+) population of 50% (Lachish <em>et al</em>. 2007). Both projections from these observed results and an epidemiological model predict local extinction at this site within 10 years of disease arrival (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). At a second site, Mt William, where DFTD signs were first reported 10 years ago, mark-recapture methods estimate a decline of 90% over 10 years. There is no evidence either of a reduction in disease prevalence or of the rate of population decline as devil abundance reduces. On current information, we therefore project at least 90% population decline over the next 10 years across the 60% of the devil's distribution currently occupied by disease, with at least a 100 km extension of the disease distribution. Together, this would amount to a further decline (in excess of the 50% already observed) of at least 70% in the next 10 years, with widespread local extinctions. Whilst the cause of decline (DFTD) is understood, it has not ceased and its effects are not reversible with current knowledge. <br> <br/>The Tasmanian Devil is found throughout mainland Tasmania, Australia, an area of 64,030 km<sup>2</sup>. The species disappeared from the Australian mainland 430 +/-160 years ago (Archer and Baynes 1972), possibly through competition with dingos (Guiler 1982) and Aboriginals (Johnson and Wroe 2003). Tasmanian Devils were introduced to the small offshore Badger Island in the mid-1990s, but as of August 2007 all Tasmanian Devils were thought to have been removed from this island (N.Mooney unpubl.).<br/><br/>Tasmanian Devils were present on Bruny Island (a large inshore island off south-eastern Tasmania) in the early 1800s, but there are no confirmed records from after 1900. Tasmanian Devils also occur on Robbins Island, a large inshore island to the north-west, semi-connected to mainland Tasmania. <br/> Tasmanian Devils are found throughout Tasmania, in all native terrestrial habitats, as well as in forestry plantations and pasture, from sea level to all but the highest peaks of Tasmania (Jones and Rose 1996, Jones and Barmuta 2000). Densities are lowest in the buttongrass plains of the south-west and, prior to Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) emergence, highest in the dry and mixed sclerophyll forests and coastal heath of Tasmania's eastern half and north-west coast (Jones and Rose 1996). Open forests and woodlands are preferred, while tall or dense wet forests are avoided (Jones and Rose 1996; Jones and Barmuta 2000). The highest population densities are found in mixed patches of grazing land and forest or woodland. Relative trapping success and spool-and-line tracking indicate that Tasmanian Devils travel through lowlands, saddles and along creeks, avoiding steep slopes and rocky areas, and favouring predictably rich sources of food such as bush/pasture mosaics on farms, carcass and rubbish dumps, and roads (Jones and Barmuta 2000, Pukk 2005; N. Mooney and D. Pemberton pers. comm.). Tasmanian Devils are able to reach very high densities, even in suboptimal habitat, if sufficient food and den sites are available. The 14 km² Badger Island at one time supported 120 Tasmanian Devils.<br/><br/>Seabird colonies, such as Short-tailed Shearwaters (or muttonbirds, <em>Puffinus tenuirostris</em>), are thought to have traditionally been a preferred habitat for Tasmanian Devils, providing an important food source. These are now much reduced along the east coast, but some sites remain along the west coast (D. Pemberton pers. comm.).<br/><br/>"
        , "This cryptic species endemic to Australia was rediscovered in western Queensland in 2013 after a 78-year period without a confirmed record. Since then, at least two additional populations and areas have been identified in Western Australia. Population size, trends, and geographic range are still very poorly understood. The population size has been placed in the band of 50-249 mature individuals, and for this reason it is classified as Endangered. <br> <br/> <p>In an attempt to explain widespread but scattered records, the species was previously thought to be nomadic or to have very large home ranges (Higgins 1999). However, limited radio- and GPS-tracking carried out by Murphy <em>et al</em>. (2017b) implies that the species is more sedentary than these speculations suggest. Movement of two tracked birds remained within an area of approximately 70 km<sup>2</sup>. Individuals moved approximately 30 km per night within a radius of less than 10 km from roosting locations.<br/>Tracked birds moved from their roosts in <em>Triodia</em>&#160;(spinifex) hummocks to feeding sites in more diverse habitats marked by large-seeded grass and forb species. Physiological modelling suggests that the species may need to visit standing water, especially during summer (Kearney <em>et al. </em>2016). <br> </br> The bird GPS-tracked by Murphy&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2017b) only visited a permanent water source once. However, a considerable amount of rain fell during the tracking period, and so ephemeral water sources were likely to be available. During winter, Night Parrots may satisfy water requirements from their diet, which may include succulent plants, such as <em>Sclerolaena </em>spp (Kearney&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).<br/>Most habitat records are of <em>Triodia </em>grasslands and/or chenopod shrublands (Garnett <em>et al</em>. 2011) in the arid and semi-arid zones, and Higgins (1999) listed <em>Astrebla </em>spp. (Mitchell grass), shrubby samphire and chenopod associations, scattered trees and shrubs, <em>Acacia aneura</em> (Mulga) woodland, treeless areas and bare gibber as associated with sightings of the species. S. Murphy (pers. comm. in TSSC 2016) recorded a similar range of habitats used or traversed by individuals in southwestern Queensland: Cretaceous sandstone, claystone, and siltstone residuals; either dominated by <em>Triodia longiceps</em> on slopes and margins of duricrust plateaus or with <em>Sclerolaena </em>spp., <em>Maireana </em>spp. (Saltbush spp.), <em>Ptilotus </em>spp. (Mulla Mulla spp.), and small areas of <em>T. longiceps</em>; with occasional watercourses with <em>Acacia cambagei </em>(stinking gidgee).&#160;The habitat of the southwestern Queensland population is naturally fragmented, and is unlikely to promote fire behaviour that results in most habitat in this area being burned by one fire event (Murphy 2015, S. Murphy pers. comm. 2016 in TSSC 2016).<br> <br/> Recent and historical accounts of nests describe a slight depression in a cavity at the end of a tunnel built into a&#160;<em>Triodia</em>&#160;hummock (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2017, Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2017a). Clutch size is reported as 2-4 eggs (Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2017a, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p> <p></p>The causes of the assumed decline of the species are “essentially guesswork” (Garnett <em>et al. </em>2011). Blyth (1996) proposed a list of threats considered realistic in the absence of direct evidence. Threats to the species are likely to vary across its range and might include predation by feral cats and foxes; soil disturbance, erosion and loss caused by herbivores (including livestock and over-abundant native and feral herbivores);&#160;degradation of habitat around water points by herbivores; competition for food by herbivores; fire;&#160;psittacine beak and feather disease, avian pox, and other diseases;&#160;illegal collection of birds or eggs;&#160;disturbance from bird-watching activities; fences; and reduction in water availability through over-use of waterholes by camels and&#160;reduced waterhole maintenance (TSSC 2016). Biophysical modelling suggests that predicted temperature increases under various climate change scenarios would increase the species's dependence on free-standing water dramatically (Kearney&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016). Thus, climate change, interacting with the spatial configuration of water points and habitats, and the concentration of feral predators at water points, may become a serious future threat.<p></p>"
        ,"A recent extensive global phylogeny of Red Foxes that included ~1,000 samples from across the species range found that Red Foxes originated in the Middle East, then radiated out, and that Red Foxes in North America are genetically distinct and probably merit recognition as a distinct species (<em>Vulpes fulva</em>) (Statham <em>et al</em>. 2014)<em>.</em> <br> </br> The Red Fox has the widest geographical range of any member of the order Carnivora (covering nearly 70 million km²) being distributed across the entire northern hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to southern North America, Europe, North Africa, the Asiatic steppes, India, and Japan. Not found in Iceland, the Arctic islands, or some parts of Siberia.&#160;Red Foxes are generally considered extinct in the Republic of Korea where there have been several mammal surveys in recent years (including the DMZ) that have not shown any evidence of foxes.<br/><br/>The European subspecies was introduced into the eastern United States (where they were relatively scarce and the Gray Fox <em>Urocyon cinereoargenteus </em>common)&#160;and Canada in the 17th century for fox hunting; however, there appears to be limited evidence for any meaningful mixing of introduced European foxes and those in North America (i.e., no Eurasian haplotypes found in foxes sampled; Statham <em>et al</em>. 2012). The species was also introduced to Australia in the 1800s, and to Tasmania in the late 1990s (although there is evidence that an eradication campaign for Red Foxes on Tasmania has proved effective; see Caley <em>et al</em>. 2015). Elsewhere introduced to the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) and to the Isle of Man (UK), although they never properly established on the Isle of Man (Reynolds and Short 2003) and may subsequently have disappeared. <br> </br>Red Foxes have been recorded in habitats as diverse as tundra, desert (though not extreme deserts) and forest, as well as in city centres (including London, Paris, Stockholm, etc.). Natural habitat is dry, mixed landscape, with abundant edge of scrub and woodland. They are also abundant on moorlands, mountains (even above the treeline, known to cross alpine passes), sand dunes and farmland from sea level to 4,500 m. In the United Kingdom, they generally prefer mosaic patchworks of scrub, woodland and farmland. Red Foxes flourish particularly well in urban areas. They are most common in residential suburbs consisting of privately owned, low-density housing and are less common where industry, commerce or council rented housing predominates (Harris and Smith 1987). In many habitats, foxes appear to be closely associated with people, even thriving in intensive agricultural areas. <br> </br>Threats to this species are highly localized and include habitat degradation, loss, and fragmentation, and exploitation, and direct and indirect persecution. For example, a regional red list assessment in Mongolia (Clark and Munkhbat&#160;2006) classified the species as Near Threatened mainly due to overhunting, while in South Korea, Red Foxes have experienced declines due to habitat loss and poaching and is generally considered extinct (Yu <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, their general versatility and eclectic diet are likely to ensure their persistence despite changes in landscape and prey base. Culling may be able to reduce numbers well below carrying capacity in large regions (Heydon and Reynolds 2000), but no known situations exist where this currently threatens species persistence on any geographical scale. Red Foxes have caused considerable damage where they have been introduced; their impacts on Australian fauna has been particularly well documented; control takes place by setting baits impregnated with 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate)., conservationmeasures: <strong>Legislation</strong><br/>Not listed in CITES Appendices at species level. However, the subspecies <em>griffithi</em>, <em>montana</em> and <em>pusilla</em> (=<em>leucopus</em>) are listed on CITES – Appendix III (India).&#160;<br/><br/>Widely regarded as a pest and unprotected. Most countries and/or states where trapping or hunting occurs have regulated closed versus open seasons and restrictions on methods of capture. In the European Union, Canada, and the Russian Federation, trapping methods are regulated under an agreement on international trapping standards between these countries, which was signed in 1997. Other countries are signatories to ISO/DIS 10990-5.2 animal (mammal) traps, which specifies standards for trap testing.<br/><br/>In Europe and North America, hunting traditions and/or legislation impose closed seasons on fox hunting. In the United Kingdom and a few other European countries, derogation from these provisions allows breeding season culling for pest-control purposes. Here, traditional hunting ethics encouraging restrained use may be at odds with harder hitting pest-control ambitions. This apparent conflict between different interest groups is particularly evident in the UK, where fox control patterns are highly regionally variable (Macdonald&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). In some regions, principal lowland areas where classical mounted hunting operates, limited economic analyses suggest that the principal motive for these communal fox hunts is as a sport – the number killed is small compared with the cost of the hunting. In these regions, most anthropogenic mortality is by individual farmers shooting foxes. The mounted communal hunts do exhibit restraint – hunting takes place for a limited season, and for a prescribed number of days per week. Elsewhere, in upland regions, communal hunting by foot with guns and dogs may make economic sense, depending on the number of lambs lost to foxes (data on this is poor), and also on the current value of lost lambs. This type of fox hunting may also be perceived as a sport by its participants.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Presence in protected areas</strong><br/>Present in most temperate-subarctic conservation areas.<br/><br/><strong>Presence in captivity</strong><br/>In addition to fur farms, Red Foxes are widely kept in small wildlife parks and zoos, but there appears to be no systematic data on their breeding success. Being extremely shy they are often poor exhibits."
        , "Listed as Endangered because of a serious population decline, estimated to exceed 50% over the last 10 years, and one that is projected to continue at a similar rate over the next 10 years based on the effects of habitat destruction and/or degradation, cane toads, and introduced predators. <br> </br> The Northern Quoll occurs in the northern parts of Australia. Historically, it occurred in northern Australia from Pilbara to south-east Queensland, extending inland as far south as Alexandria. More recently, there has been substantial decline in southern and eastern Queensland and the Cape York Peninsula. The Northern Quoll has apparently disappeared from most or all of the lower rainfall former range in the Northern Territory and south-east and south-west Kimberley. A substantial decline has also occurred in Pilbara (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species has been recorded from Groote Eylandt and the nearby North-east Island, Marchinbar Island (in the Wessel group), Inglis Island (in the English Company Islands group) and Vanderlin Island (Sir Edward Pellew group). It has also been recently translocated to Astell and Pobassoo Islands in the English Company island group (Woinarski 2005). This species occurs up to around 1,300 m asl. <br> <br/>The Northern Quoll occurs in a range of habitats including Eucalyptus open forest, monsoon rainforest, and savannah woodlands. The species is most abundant (and apparently with less fluctuations) in rocky environments. In north Queensland, it is most common in coastal and/or high altitude rocky areas and in drier habitats of upland tablelands (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). This species is a generalist, as it occurs in a wide range of habitats and its diet consists of a variety of invertebrates and small vertebrates (Woinarski 2005). The Northern Quoll shelters in hollow logs, rock crevices, caves, and tree hollows (Woinarski 2005). It is mostly a ground-dwelling species, but is also an adept climber (Woinarski 2005). <br> <br/> Current threats are uncertain, but the species may be vulnerable to disease, possibly related to the presence of cats. Cats and dogs are known to kill individuals, although they apparently do not like to eat them. Predation is the main cause of mortality in some areas (exacerbated by changes in fire regimes that result in more frequent burning), particularly woodland and forest habitats (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). There have been recent substantial population declines in the Iron Range (Queensland), Cape York Peninsula, and the top end of the Northern Territory associated with the spread of cane toads and land-use changes. For instance, major declines to regional extinction have been reported for Northern Quolls following cane toad invasion on Cape York Peninsula (Burnett 1997). Northern Quolls appear to be particularly susceptible to the poison of cane toads, and are killed when they attempt to kill or consume the toads (Woinarski 2005). The species has also disappeared from coastal lowland areas in north Queensland following agricultural and urban development (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996)."
        , "This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup> combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). The population trend is not known, but the population is not believed to be decreasing sufficiently rapidly to approach the thresholds under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern. <br> </br> <strong>Behaviour</strong> <br> </br> All populations of this species undergo post-breeding dispersive movements (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Populations breeding in the tropics are sedentary (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) or partially migratory (in relation to rainfall) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), whereas Palearctic and Nearctic populations are migratory (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The timing of the breeding season varies geographically (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) although temperate breeders tend to nest in the spring and summer (e.g. April to July) and tropical breeders nest in the part of the rain cycle when food becomes maximally available (this may be during the rains or in the dry season) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species typically breeds in colonies of tens, hundreds or even a thousand pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), sometimes with other species (e.g. 450 pairs in a mixed colony of over 3,000 nests in Australia) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Some populations also show a tendency to breed solitarily or in small groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Outside of the breeding season the species may feed solitarily (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) or in small loose groups (Marchant and Higgins 1990) (e.g. of 12-50 individuals) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), although flocks of hundreds or more individuals may form where food is abundant (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species is a diurnal feeder (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) but is most active at dawn and dusk (although in coastal environments it feeding habits are determined by tidal stages) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), and roosts at night in trees (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) alongside lakes or rivers or in mangroves, often with other species (Langrand 1990). <br> </br><strong>Habitat</strong> <br> </br>The species inhabits all kinds of inland and coastal wetlands (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) although it is mainly found along the coast in the winter (e.g. in the Palearctic Region) (Snow and Perrins 1998) or during droughts (e.g. in Australia) (Marchant and Higgins 1990). It frequents river margins, lakes shores, marshes, flood-plains (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), oxbows, streams (Snow and Perrins 1998), damp meadows (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), rice-fields, drainage ditches (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), aquaculture ponds, reservoirs (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and sewage works (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005) inland, and the shallows of salt-lakes (Marchant and Higgins 1990), saltpans, mudflats, coastal swamps, mangroves (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), saltmarshes, seagrass flats, offshore coral reefs, lagoons (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and estuaries when in coastal locations (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <br> </br><strong>Diet</strong> <br> </br> In aquatic habitats its diet consists of fish, amphibians, snakes, aquatic insects and crustaceans although in drier habitats terrestrial insects, lizards, small birds and mammals are more commonly taken (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is constructed from sticks (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and vegetation (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) and is normally positioned over water at a height of 1-15 m (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) in reedbeds, bamboos (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), bushes, trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. willow <em>Salix</em> spp.)<strong>, </strong>mangroves (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and other plants near water or on islands in sites that are protected from ground predators (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species usually nests colonially in single- or mixed-species groups where nests may be less than 1 m apart or touching, although they are usually placed more spread out in reedbeds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Breeding pairs may also reuse nests from previous years (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). <strong>Management information </strong>Breeding site conservation should include colony protection, control of disturbance and vegetation management, and the conservation of feeding areas should include the management of hydrology, salt intrusion, contaminants and disturbance (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). An artificial island nesting site created in the Camargue, France succeeded in attracting nesting pairs to the area (Hafner 2000). <br> </br> The species is threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss (Marchant and Higgins 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) for example through drainage, grazing, clearing, burning, increased salinity, groundwater extraction and invasion by exotic plants (Marchant and Higgins 1990). Breeding colonies in Madagascar may be declining due to egg and chick gathering from colonies by local people (Langrand 1990, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and the species previously suffered from intense persecution for the plume trade (this is no longer a threat) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)."
        , "The two species of Elephant Seals, <em>Mirounga leonina</em> and <em>M. angustirostris</em>, share many similarities in appearance and behaviour and differ primarily in their range and in the timing of their terrestrial periods ashore (Bonner 1989, Ling and Bryden 1992). Speciation is thought to have occurred approximately one million years ago (Hoelzel <em>et al</em>. 1993). <br> </br>Southern Elephant Seals are the largest of all pinnipeds with adult males reaching masses of two to four tons and lengths of up to 4.5 m. They show considerable sexual dimorphism, with adult females only reaching masses of 400-900 kg and average lengths of 2.8 m. Newborn pups weigh between 40 and 46 kg (Laws 1993). Females first haul out to pup at ages of three to six years, and males typically breed for the first time at six to ten years of age (Laws 1956,&#160;Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962a, Jones 1981,&#160;McCann 1981,&#160;Pistorius&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001,&#160;Kirkman <em>et al.</em> 2004). At Marion Island, less than 5% of females survived beyond 13 years of age, and less than 5% of males beyond 10 years of age (de Bruyn 2009). Longevity of 23 years has been recorded for adult females at Macquarie Island (Hindell and Little 1988).<br/><br/>Southern Elephant Seals undergo an annual double migration between foraging grounds and isolated haulout sites, at which they are born and where they breed in the austral spring, moult in the austral summer, and as immatures haulout in the winter (Bartholomew and Hubbs 1960, Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962b, Hindell and Burton 1988). Southern Elephant Seals are predominantly marine. Adult females spend more than 85% of each year at sea while adult males spend less than 80% (Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962a, Hindell and Burton 1988, McIntyre <em>et al.</em> 2010). Their foraging grounds may be located over 5,000 km from their terrestrial haulout sites (Bester and Pansegrouw 1992, Jonker and Bester 1998,&#160;Campagna&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999,&#160;Bailleul&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).<br/><br/>Southern Elephant Seals spend most of their at-sea time foraging in association with frontal systems, currents and shifting marginal ice-edge zones. Studies of foraging sites suggest that they are sensitive to fine-scale variation in bathymetry and ocean properties (sea-ice concentration and sea temperature profiles) (Bailleul <em>et al.</em> 2007, Biuw <em>et al.</em> 2010). Southern Elephant Seals are prodigious divers. Dive depth and duration vary during the year and between the sexes, but mostly range from 200 to 700 m deep and from 20 to just over 30 minutes in duration (Biuw <em>et al.</em> 2010, McIntyre <em>et al.</em> 2010). Both sexes spend over 65% of their lives below 100 m. The maximum record dive depth is 2,133 m for an adult male (McIntyre <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>The diet varies between populations and seasons. It consist primarily of myctophid and notothenid fish and squid (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1999,&#160;Piatkowski&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002,&#160;Bradshaw&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003,&#160;van den Hoff&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003,&#160;Cherel <em>et al.</em> 2008, Newland <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>Four types of terrestrial periods are experienced over the course of their lives: the breeding, moult and winter haulouts, and the natal terrestrial period. The mating system is mate-defense polygyny. Breeding seasons are highly synchronized (Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962b, Laws 1956, McCann 1981,&#160;Bonner 1989). Adult females spend approximately a month ashore during the breeding season, while adult males may spend one to three months ashore. During this time adult females will haul out in large aggregations that may contain up to a thousand animals (Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962a,&#160;Bonner 1989). Some three to seven days after females come ashore they give birth to a single pup, which they will suckle for some three weeks. Mating takes place shortly before the pup is weaned and the adult female returns to the sea a few days later. Breeding aggregations are ephemeral, and do not last beyond the breeding season. Access to all females in one breeding aggregation is defended by a dominant adult male. In larger breeding aggregations, subdominant males also gain access to females (Laws 1956,&#160;Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962a, McCann 1981).<br/><br/>Killer Whales are the primary predators of Southern Elephant Seals (Reisinger <em>et al.</em> 2011) but Leopard Seals are also known to take pups (Gwyn 1953). <br> </br> <p>Southern Elephant Seals face few threats and conflicts today, since they live far from human population centres and have minimal interactions with commercial fisheries. Intensive fishing could, however, deplete important prey stocks (Hanchet <em>et al</em>. 2003). The possible effects of global climate change on Southern Elephant Seals are not well known but such changes may negatively impact prey populations or change marine habitat (Learmonth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2012). It is also possible that a reduction in sea ice due to climate change may benefit Southern Elephant Seals (van den Hoff <em>et al</em>. 2014). Southern Elephant Seals that haul out at mainland sites could come in contact with domestic and wild animals and be exposed to a variety of diseases including morbilliviruses (Lavigne and Schmitz 1990).</p>"

        "This species is listed as Near Threatened because it is projected to undergo a moderately rapid population decline over the next three generations owing to the projected effects of climate change. However, it should be noted that there is considerable uncertainty over future climatic changes and how these will impact the species. <br><br/>This species is marine and pelagic, feeding mainly on fish in Antarctic waters (although krill and cephalopods can be important dietary components). It breeds almost exclusively on fast ice near the coast or on the coast itself, sometimes up to as much as 200 km from the open sea. Only one known colony occurs wholly on land (Robertson <em>et al.</em> 2014), while a small number uses available land for parts of their breeding cycle. Four colonies are known to locate at least temporarily onto the top of ice shelves (Fretwell <em>et al. </em>2014). It has an annual breeding cycle, arriving at colonies in late March to April, and lays eggs in May/ June. Chicks fledge in December/January (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <br> </br><p>The species is threatened by the effects of projected climate change, primarily through ongoing and future decreases in sea ice concentration and thickness, as affected by wind speed and persistence, as well as changes in other climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation (Ainley<em> et al.</em> 2010). The decrease of a colony on Emperor Island from c.150 pairs in<em> </em>the 1970s to fewer than 20 pairs by 1999 (at which time it occurred on land), with the apparent disappearance of the colony by 2009, has been linked to a decline in seasonal sea ice duration, particularly in seasonal stable ice suitable for nesting (Trathan<em> et al. </em>2011). In recent years, Antarctic sea ice increased in extent, especially in East Antarctica. In June 2014, the extent was over 2 million km<sup>2</sup> above the long-term average. Increased run-off of fresh water from melting glaciers in West Antarctica and strengthening southerly winds in the Ross Sea region were suggested to decrease sea surface temperatures (Fan <em>et al.</em> 2014). Alternatively, increases in the wind strength of westerly winds may increase sea ice extent. However, Ferreira <em>et al.</em> (2015) indicated that this could be a short-term response only (c.20 years), and that over the long-term, the effect will still be a decrease in sea ice extent. The Antarctic continues to change, hence so too does Emperor Penguin habitat. In 1994-2003, the loss of ice from ice shelves around the continent was estimated to occur at a rate of 25±64 km<sup>3</sup>/yr. From 2003 to 2012, ice loss increased to 310±74 km<sup>3</sup>/yr and in West Antarctica, the fastest warming part of Antarctica, ice loss increased by 70% (Paolo <em>et al. </em>2015). In the much longer term, Emperor Penguin habitat is likely to deteriorate to a point where suitable locations occur only in restricted refugia or, in the worst case scenario, may be completely unavailable (Jenouvrier <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Disturbance is a threat in some areas, with problems to colonies caused by the proximity to scientific bases and aircraft movements (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Sites visited by tourists collectively account for a very small percentage of the global population (J. Croxall<em> in litt. </em>2017), but the impacts of tourism on breeding penguins remain uncertain (Trathan <em>et al. </em>2011). Other human impacts potentially include disturbance from researchers, construction of new science facilities and Antarctic krill fisheries. Fisheries for Antarctic Silverfish <em>Pleuragramma antarcticum </em>could potentially be developed in the future. Harvesting of silverfish and krill could pose a threat, if management does not adequately take into account the needs of species that feed upon these species. Oil spills may also be important at local scales. Protection of habitat at sea is important, with the designation of appropriate protection for transit, foraging and rafting areas at sea.</p>"
        , "This species qualifies as Vulnerable because the global population appears to have declined rapidly over the last three generations (36 years). The primary drivers of declines are uncertain but could include climatic variation and competition for food from commercial fisheries.<br/><p></p> <br> </br> <p><span><em>Eudyptes chrysolophus</em><span><em> </em>breeds in at least&#160;258 colonies at c. 55 breeding sites (Crossin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), including southern <strong>Chile</strong>, the <strong>Falkland Islands<em> </em></strong>(<strong>Malvinas</strong>), <strong>South Georgia</strong> (<strong>Georgia del Sur</strong>) and the South Sandwich Islands (Islas Sandwich del Sur), the South Orkney and South Shetland Islands, Bouvet Island (<strong>to Norway</strong>), Prince Edward and Marion Islands (<strong>South Africa</strong>), Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Islands (<strong>French Southern Territories</strong>), Heard and McDonald Islands (<strong>to Australia</strong>) and very locally on the Antarctic Peninsula.</span></p><p>Important populations exist at Isles Crozet (2.2 million pairs, including 1 million on Iles des Pingouins), Kerguelen (1.8 million pairs), Heard Island (1 million pairs), South Georgia (1 million pairs) and Marion Island (290,000 pairs). The population in the Patagonian Shelf region is estimated at 25,000 breeding pairs (Oehler <em>et al.</em> 2008, Kirkwood <em>et al.</em> 2007, Crossin <em>et al.</em> 2013). The Falkland Islands (Malvinas) population is estimated at no more than 1000 individuals (Stanworth <em>Pers. Comm.</em>). The rest of the population is contained in Chile in at least 12 known colonies. Diego Ramirez is the largest colony with 15,600 pairs (Kirkwood <em>et al.</em> 2007).</p><p>Geolocation tracking during winter revealed that individuals from Kerguelen showed strong inter-annual fidelity to their wintering sites. They spent most of their time in a narrow latitudinal band (47-49 degrees S) within the central Indian Ocean (70-110 degrees E), corresponding oceanographically to the Polar Frontal Zone (Bost&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009; Thiebot&#160;<em>et al.</em>2011). In contrast, individuals from South Georgia spend most of their time widely distributed across the Scotia Sea during winter (Ratcliffe&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).</p><p></p> <br> </br><p>Climate change is an important potential candidate for explaining recent declines. Large-scale environmental changes, particularly those related to sea temperatures could be contributing to habitat loss, indirect ecosystem effects, direct species mortality and reduced reproductive success, but the nature and level of impacts remain unclear as there may be divergent responses in different populations; climate was found to be have potentially positive effects in the short to medium term for the population studied at Bird Island, South Georgia, whereas changes to predation dynamics appear to be the main factor driving declines (Horswill <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2016).<br/><br/>Historical and continuing prey competition with fur seals <em>Arctocephalus</em> spp. at South Georgia is considered to have substantially contributed to declines noted over the past several decades, with the fur seal population increasing from an estimated 30,000 to c. 3 million in the past few decades (Barlow <em>et al.</em> 2002). Recovery of fur seals at the Prince Edward Islands could increase competition for prey as well as causing increased predation pressure on penguins (Dyer and Crawford 2015). Increasing seal populations could also block access to breeding sites thereby inhibiting colony growth, as demonstrated on Bouvet Island (Isaksen <em>et al.</em> 1997). In the South Georgia population, predation appears to be of secondary concern with relatively few fur seals predating penguins and local penguin declines starting well in advance of increases in seal predation (J. Croxall in litt. 2017). Giant Petrels <em>Macronectes</em> spp. contribute to predation pressures on immature penguins, targeting them in the vulnerable fledgling phase (Horswill <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p> </p><p>Commercial fisheries could represent a threat through incidental capture and resource competition. Long-line fisheries at winter feeding grounds have inflicted limited bycatch mortality on Macaroni Penguins (Dyer and Crawford 2015) and harvesting of Antarctic krill could reduce food availability if management does not adequately take into account the dietary needs of the species. Invasive mammals including cats, mice and rabbits are present on a number of sub-Antarctic islands but their current impact on the species is thought to be negligible (Crossin <em>et al.</em> 2013). Breeding colonies on Marion Island have previously shown declines following outbreaks of avian cholera and other unknown diseases (Cooper <em>et al. </em>2009). Human impacts potentially also include disturbance from tourists, scientists, construction of new science facilities and fisheries. Oil spills may also be important at local scales. Protection of habitat on land and at sea remains important, with the designation of appropriate protection for transit, foraging and rafting areas at sea.</p><p></p>"
        , "<p>This species is listed as Endangered as data from South Georgia (Georgias del Sur), which holds around half the global population, indicate a very rapid rate of decline of the world population over three generations (90 years), even if colonies lacking trend information are assumed to be stable. The major driver of declines is likely to be incidental mortality in longline fisheries.</p><p></p> <p></p> <br> </br><p><strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is normally a biennial breeder, although 5.4% and 1% of successful breeders on Marion Island and Bird Island (South Georgia) respectively, breed in the following season. Birds return to colonies between late September and early October, laying occurs in October and chicks hatch by December. Chicks fledge from April to May. Immatures return to breeding colonies at the earliest at 3 years of age, but generally at 6 or 7 years old. First breeding can be as early as 7 years, but the average on Campbell Island is 13.5 years old, and the modal age on South Georgia is 12 years old. Grey-headed Albatrosses feed by surface-seizing but can also dive to six metres (<a>Huin and Prince 1997</a>). Substantial segregation in foraging areas is apparent for male and female Grey-headed Albatrosses during incubation at South Georgia, with males travelling on average further than females (Phillips <em>et al.</em> 2004). At Iles Kerguelen, Campbell Island and South Georgia (Islas Georgias del Sur), the species is principally an oceanic forager, concentrating its foraging in the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone, but in years of low food availability, chick-rearing birds from South Georgia (Islas Georgias del Sur) increase the proportion of time spent in Antarctic shelf-slope waters. Prey biogeography also indicates some neritic foraging around Iles Kerguelen and Campbell Island during chick rearing (ACAP 2009). At Marion Island, incubating birds foraged in the Sub-tropical Frontal Zone and the Subantarctic Zone in association with mesoscale eddies, whereas during chick-rearing, foraging was concentrated in the Subantarctic and Polar Frontal Zones to the south-west of the island, also in association with eddies (Nel <em>et al. </em>2000,<em> </em>2001).&#160;<strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding </em>This species breeds on steep slopes or cliffs, that are generally covered with tussock-grass.&#160;<strong>Diet </strong>The diet varies with locality and year, mainly consisting of cephalopods and fish, but crustaceans, carrion and lampreys are locally important (Prince 1980, Cherel <em>et al.</em> 2002, Xavier <em>et al.</em> 2003, Arata <em>et al.</em> 2004). It actively scavenges longline baits.</p> <br> </br><p>Incidental capture by commercial longline fisheries represents a major threat to this species. In Australian waters, up to c. 400 individuals (over 80% juvenile) were killed annually in 1989-1995 by Japanese longliners (Gales <em>et al.</em> 1998). Despite mainly foraging over oceanic waters, the species also interacts with longline fisheries targeting Patagonian Toothfish <em>Dissostichus eleginoides</em> in shelf areas (ACAP 2009). In the Indian Ocean, illegal or unregulated fishing for Patagonian Toothfish killed an estimated 10,000-20,000 albatrosses (mainly this species) in 1997 and 1998 (CCAMLR 1997, CCAMLR 1998). Due to its circumpolar distribution, <em>T. chrysostoma</em> is potentially vulnerable to Southern Ocean pelagic fisheries worldwide (with the exception of the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone; G. Taylor <em>in litt.</em> 2008). The extensive use of the Subtropical Convergence and Sub-Antarctic Zones by incubating birds from Marion Island, especially females, bring them into contact with intense Southern Bluefin Tuna <em>Thunnus maccoyii</em> longline fishing activity in international waters (40-45°) (ACAP 2009). In addition, bycatch of Grey-headed Albatross has also been recorded in the poorly regulated small-scale longline operations off the coast of Peru, suggesting that mortality in these operations is also significant (Mangel 2012). </p> <p>Long-term declines on Campbell began well before local longline fishery development, and appear to be caused by environmental factors, possibly rising sea-surface temperatures resulting in food shortages. Pardo <em>et al</em>. (2017) demonstrated that adult mortality from bycatch was exacerbated by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and associated reductions in food availability, indicating that periodic temperature extremes are at least contributing to a significant population decline.</p> Another threat is posed by introduced House Mice <em>Mus musculus</em>. On Marion Island, up to 5% of Grey-headed Albatross chicks are killed by mice each year and the rate is likely to increase unless mice are eradicated (Dilley <em>et al.</em> 2016).<p></p>"
        "<p> </p><p>The Humpback Whale is a cosmopolitan species with a large range covering all oceans. The current global population is estimated at 135,000 and the mature population at about 84,000, which is higher than the level of three generations ago. This is true of the global population as well as the three main regional populations individually – North Pacific, North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere. The species does not, therefore, qualify for a Red List threatened category, and is listed as Least Concern. The Arabian Sea subpopulation appears to be isolated, is very small, and is listed separately as Endangered (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p> <p></p> <br> </br><p> </p><p> </p><p>With few exceptions, such as the Arabian Sea population, Humpback Whales undertake long migrations between breeding grounds in tropical coastal waters in winter to feeding grounds in middle and high latitudes (Clapham 2018).<br/> <br/> In the Southern Hemisphere, they appear to feed mainly in the antarctic and subantarctic, where the diet consists almost exclusively of euphausiids (Krill, <em>Euphausia superba</em>) (Mackintosh 1970), although some feeding has been observed in the Benguela Current ecosystem on the migration route west of South Africa (Best <em>et al</em>. 1995); suspected prey species in that region are euphausiids (<em>E. lucens</em><em>)</em> and amphipods (<em>Themisto gaudichaudii</em><em>)</em>. Some Humpback Whales feed in summer in mid-latitude (41°-44°S) Chilean waters (Hucke-Gaete<em> et al</em>. 2013) <br/> <br/> Few data on diet in other areas are available. Humpback Whales caught off Newfoundland and Labrador in the 1950s and 1960s were consuming mainly Capelin (<em>Mallotus villotus</em>) (Mitchell 1973). Those caught off California in the early 20th century were eating mainly euphausiids and sardines (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 1997). Humpback Whales caught in the northern North Pacific in the 1950s were feeding mainly on euphausiids and fish (Nemoto 1959). In areas of Alaska and the North Atlantic, Humpback Whales have also been observed feeding in coordinated fashion on schools of Pacific Herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>), Sand Lance (<em>Ammodytes</em> spp.), and (more rarely) Mackerel (<em>Scomber scombrus</em>), herding the school together with bubble nets, clouds or curtains (Hain <em>et al</em>. 1982).<br/> <br/> The timing of acquisition of tooth rake marks attributable to Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) indicates that Humpback Whale calves, but usually not subadults and adults, are subject to predation (Mehta <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p> <p></p> <p></p> <br> </br> <p>Although modern commercial whaling seriously depleted all Humpback populations, some of which had already been reduced by pre-modern whaling, the species has demonstrated remarkable resilience, and there have been substantial increases in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere. Humpback whales have been legally protected from commercial whaling worldwide since 1966, and there have been few catches since 1968. It is unclear whether there has been any recovery in the small, isolated population in the Arabian Sea.<br/><br/>Today, small numbers only are taken for local consumption in Greenland (up to 10 annually) and the island of Bequia (St. Vincent and the Grenadines) (up to four annually), with occasional takes elsewhere (IWC 2018b).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales, along with North Atlanatic Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena</em> <em>glacialis</em>), seem to be the most vulnerable of the large whales to becoming accidentally entangled, often fatally, in fishing gear and sometimes other debris. They are also vulnerable to injury by ship strikes, which can also be fatal. In most areas, the majority of entanglements (Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2009), and also the majority of ship strikes, are likely to go undetected, but there is no generally accepted method for extrapolating from the observed events to estimate totals.<br/><br/>State members of the IWC are encouraged to report bycatches and ship strikes annually to the IWC, but few do so. The figures submitted in 2018 for entanglements include: USA 78 (26 in the Atlantic in 2015, 52 in the Pacific in 2016); Australia 46; Greenland 5, Japan 3, and New Zealand, Argentina, Norway, and Spain (1 each) (Hughes 2019). The reported ship strike numbers were: USA 13, Australia 5, and Brazil 1. &#160;The figures include some potentially non-fatal incidents (such as whales entangled and released).<br/><br/>Minimum estimates of average annual deaths in US waters are: west coast (2012-16) - 16.7 from entanglement and 2.1 from ship strikes (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2018); east coast (2010-14) ­– 7.2 from entanglements and 1.8 from ship strikes (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017); Alaska and Hawaii (2011-15) − 18 from entanglements in fishing gear, 2.8 from unspecified marine debris, and 4.4 from ship strikes (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2018). Urbán <em>et al</em>. (2017) reported 95 cases of entanglement of Humpback Whales on the Mexican Pacific coast during 2004-2017 of which 42 were released, 6 died and the fate of the others was either unknown or considered not to be severely injured.<br/><br/>In a study of Humpback entanglements in Scottish fishing gear during 1992-2016, Ryan <em>et al</em>. (2016) found that most Humpback Whales spent only brief periods in Scottish waters, but that the entanglement rate per day of whale presence was such that it would be unsustainable for a population that fed regularly in Scottish waters.<br/><br/>The distribution of Humpbacks in the Arabian Sea overlaps that of fisheries known to be dangerous to Humpbacks, and 30-40% of the photographed whales showed entanglement-related scars (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p><p></p>"

        "Addax is listed as Critically Endangered because the total population is estimated to number under 100, well below the threshold of 250 mature individuals, and all or almost all (90-100%) are in one subpopulation in the Termit Tin Toumma region of Niger. Numbers continue to decline due to poaching and disturbance from oil exploration. Latest field surveys indicate that the species has probably already reached the threshold for Critically Endangered under criterion D (&lt;50 mature individuals). <br> </br> Although long extinct in North Africa, Addax were still present in fair numbers in Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Chad up until the late 1960s and early 1970s (Newby 2013). In 2013 the total global population was estimated at probably fewer than 300 animals surviving in the wild, distributed unevenly along a narrow, 600-km-long band lying between Termit/Tin Toumma in Niger and the Djourab sand sea in Chad (Newby 2013).&#160;Termit/Tin Toumma appears to be&#160;the last&#160;viable population of Addax in the world, with ground and aerial surveys carried out in 2004&#160;indicating a population of around 200 individuals&#160;(Wacher&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004). Sightings of Addax have declined since 2007. During a field trip carried out in June 2015 by the Sahara Conservation Fund&#160;in&#160;Termit/Tin Toumma, no animals were seen during a thorough survey including all the shade trees, and only footprints of around 25 adults and three calves were found (SCF 2015a)&#160; An aerial survey in March 2016 located only three living animals; remains of Addax and Dorcas Gazelle were also found, left by poachers (Rabeil 2016). The remaining animals are assumed to have been destroyed or dispersed. It is highly probable that there are now &lt;100 Addax left in the wild, and perhaps many fewer. The species is at serious risk of becoming extinct in the wild. <br> </br> The most desert-loving large ungulate, occurring in areas of extreme temperature and aridity (less than 100 mm annually) (Newby 2013). With the exception of truly mountainous areas, Addax have been recorded from all major habitat types in the Sahara, from gravelly and sandy plains, to dune fields, sandy basins and depressions, pans and wadi systems; their preference is for harder, packed sands and flatter areas within and between dune fields that support perennial vegetation (Newby 2013, and references therein).<br/><br/>Addax are nomadic, wandering over large areas in search of grazing. In the Sahel, movements tend to be north-south in direction, for example from the more arid desert to the less arid sub-desert and Sahel (Gillet 1965, Newby 1978). In central Niger, movement may also be east-west, for example from the open desert towards the better-wooded and more varied habitats of the Aïr and Termit mountains (Hue 1960). The Addax is well known for its utilisation of extremely desolate, inhospitable, and arid habitats (Dragesco-Joffé 1993). <br> </br> The primary factor in the decline of Addax is uncontrolled hunting over many years, a process accelerating with the arrival of motor vehicles and modern weapons in the 20th century. Drought and the extension of pastoralism into desert lands, thanks to the increase in wells, have also taken a heavy toll, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s (Beudels-Jamar <em>et al</em>. 2005, Newby 2013). In recent years, the only near-viable population in Termit Tin Toumma NNR has been subject to disturbance by oil exploration and production and to shooting by their military escorts (Duncan <em>et al</em>. 2014). Finally, political instability in Libya has caused an increase in traffic in the core area of Addax distribution and a new kind of opportunistic hunting has been developed by traffickers (T. Rabeil pers. comm). <br> </br>"
        , "Preliminary genetic evidence suggests that there may be at least two species of African elephants, namely the Savanna Elephant (<span>Loxodonta africana</span>) and the Forest Elephant (<span>Loxodonta cyclotis</span>). A third species, the West African Elephant, has also been postulated. The African Elephant Specialist Group believes that more extensive research is required to support the proposed re-classification. Premature allocation into more than one species may leave hybrids in an uncertain conservation status (IUCN SSC African Elephant Specialist Group 2003). For this reason, this assessment was conducted for the single species as currently described, encompassing all populations. <br> </br>African Elephants currently occur in 37 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (see accompanying map in Supplementary Material, sourced from Blanc <span>et al</span>. 2007). They are known to have become nationally extinct in Burundi in the 1970s, in The Gambia in 1913, in Mauritania in the 1980s, and in Swaziland in 1920, where they were reintroduced in the 1980s and 1990s.<br/><br/>Although large tracts of continuous elephant range remain in parts of Central, Eastern and Southern Africa, elephant distribution is becoming increasingly fragmented across the continent. <br/><br/>The quality of knowledge available on elephant distribution varies considerably across the species' range. While distribution patterns are well understood in most of Eastern, Southern and West Africa, there is little reliable information on elephant distribution for much of Central Africa. <br> </br>Although elephant populations may at present be declining in parts of their range, major populations in Eastern and Southern Africa, accounting for over two thirds of all known elephants on the continent, have been surveyed, and are currently increasing at an average annual rate of 4.0% per annum (Blanc <span>et al</span>. 2005, 2007). As a result, more than 15,000 elephants are estimated to have been recruited into the population in 2006 and, if current rates of increase continue, the number of elephants born in these populations between 2005 and 2010 will be larger than the currently estimated total number of elephants in Central and West Africa combined. In other words, the magnitude of ongoing increases in Southern and Eastern Africa are likely to outweigh the magnitude of any likely declines in the other two regions. <br> </br>Poaching for ivory and meat has traditionally been the major cause of the species' decline. Although illegal hunting remains a significant factor in some areas, particularly in Central Africa, currently the most important perceived threat is the loss and fragmentation of habitat caused by ongoing human population expansion and rapid land conversion. A specific manifestation of this trend is the reported increase in human-elephant conflict, which further aggravates the threat to elephant populations."
        , "<p>Listed as Critically Endangered as the species numbers (at best approximately 200 mature individuals) may be undergoing a&#160;continuing decline due to climate and human/livestock impact, and no subpopulation numbers in excess of 50 mature individuals. The species may also meet the threshold for Critically Endangered under D, as there may be less than 50 mature individuals in the wild.</p> <br> </br> The African Wild Ass occurs in Eritrea and Ethiopia, and some animals may persist in Djibouti, Somalia, Sudan and Egypt, but there is no recent information available (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013). Yalden <em>et al</em>. (1996) recorded them to 1,500 m in Ethiopia.<br/><br/>Two subspecies are recognized. The Nubian Wild Ass, <em>E. a. africanus</em>, lived in the Nubian desert of north-eastern Sudan, from east of the Nile River to the shores of the Red Sea, and south to the Atbara River and into northern Eritrea (Watson 1982). During aerial flights in the 1970s, wild asses were seen in the Barka Valley of Eritrea and in the border area between Eritrea and the Sudan (Watson 1982). The Somali Wild Ass, <em>E. a. somaliensis</em>, was found in the Denkelia region of Eritrea, the Danakil Desert and the Awash River Valley in the Afar region of north-eastern Ethiopia, western Djibouti, and into the Ogaden region of eastern Ethiopia. In Somalia, they ranged from Meit and Erigavo in the north to the Nugaal Valley, and as far south as the Shebele River (Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The current range of the African Wild Ass in Ethiopia and Eritrea is approximately 23,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Kebede 2013, Teclai 2006). DNA extracted from faecal samples collected from animals in Eritrea and Ethiopia resulted in the identification of five mitochondrial DNA haplotypes: one haplotype (group of polymorphisms) is specific to the Eritrean population (haplotype D); one haplotype specific to the Ethiopian population (haplotype E); and three shared haplotypes (A, B, and C). These results suggest that there is and/or has been gene flow between the subpopulations (Afrera, Serdo) in Ethiopia and the population in Eritrea (Oakenfull <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br> </br>The primary habitat is arid and semi-arid bushland and grassland. In Eritrea and Ethiopia, the African Wild Ass lives in volcanic landscape of the Great Rift Valley where they range from below sea level in the Dalool Depression to 2,000 m (Moehlman <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Eritrea and Ethiopia, limited observations indicate that African Wild Asses are primarily grazers, but that they will also utilize browse. Typical of arid habitat equids, the only stable groups are composed of a female and her offspring. Females do associate with other females or with males, but even temporary groups are small. Low density and low sociability may be due to low forage quality and availability. In the Mille-Serdo Wild Ass Reserve the preferred forage is <em>Aristida</em> sp., <em>Chrysopogon plumulosus</em>, <em>Dactyloctenium schindicum</em>, <em>Digitaria</em> sp., <em>Lasiurus scindicus</em>, and <em>Sporobolus iocladus</em> (Kebede 1999, Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Eritrea, <em>Pannicum turgidium</em> is an important forage species (Teclai 2006). <br> </br> <p>The major threat to the African Wild Ass is hunting for food and medicinal purposes; for example, body parts and soup made from bones are used for treating tuberculosis, constipation, rheumatism, backache, and bone ache (Kebede 1999, Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al. </em>2013). Limited access to drinking water and forage (largely due to competition with livestock) is also a major constraint, with reproductive females and foals less than three-months old most at risk. Hence, it will continue to be important to determine critical water supplies and basic forage requirements, allowing management authorities to determine (in consultation with local pastoralists) how to conserve the African Wild Ass (Kebede 1999, 2007; Moehlman 2002; Teclai 2006; Moehlman <em>et al.</em> 2013). The third possible threat to the survival of the African Wild Ass is potential interbreeding with the domestic donkey (Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al. </em>2013). However, there is no scientific evidence that indicates hybridization of <em>Equus africanus somaliensis </em>with domestic donkeys (Kebede 2013). &#160;</p>"

While Black Rhino numbers have more than doubled since bottoming out in the mid 1990s (due to increased protection and enhanced biological management to keep more subpopulations productive), the species qualifies as CR due to the scale of the decline in numbers over the past three generations as a result of very heavy poaching in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. Three generations ago (i.e., 44 years back in 1973) the point estimate for Black Rhinos was 37,807 rhinos and despite numbers more than doubling from a low of 2,354 were only 5,495 as of end 2017.

However, because of high levels of secondary plant chemicals, much woody plant browse (especially many evergreen species) in some areas is unpalatable. Failure to appreciate this, has in the past led to carrying capacities being over-estimated in some areas. Apart from plant species composition and size structure, Black Rhino carrying capacity is related to rainfall, soil nutrient status, fire histories, levels of grass interference, extent of frost and densities of other large browsers. To maintain rapid population growth rates and prevent potential habitat damage if the population overshoots carrying capacity, populations of Black Rhinos should be managed at densities below long term ecological carrying capacity (i.e., below zero growth densities).

The main threat to the species is illegal hunting (poaching) to supply the illegal international rhino horn trade. It is estimated that currently around 95% of rhino horn sourced in Africa for end user illegal markets in SE Asia are from this source (Emslie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). Rhino horn has traditionally had two main uses: use in Chinese medicine, and ornamental use. Recently rhino horn has become a highly prized material for making carved expensive high-status items such bowls and bangles. In the past it was also used to produce ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers (jambiyas) worn in Yemen and some Middle East countries. Historically rhino horn was also used in traditional Chinese medicine (as a fever reducer). However, most recently it appears to be shavings from carvings that are illegally sold to the medicinal market at lower prices than worked items. While Black Rhino numbers continue to increase at a continental-level poaching has slowed overall growth. Some populations have also declined. Black rhino poaching peaked in 2015 and has been declining since.

        "Addax is listed as Critically Endangered because the total population is estimated to number under 100, well below the threshold of 250 mature individuals, and all or almost all (90-100%) are in one subpopulation in the Termit Tin Toumma region of Niger. Numbers continue to decline due to poaching and disturbance from oil exploration. Latest field surveys indicate that the species has probably already reached the threshold for Critically Endangered under criterion D (&lt;50 mature individuals). <br> </br> Although long extinct in North Africa, Addax were still present in fair numbers in Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Chad up until the late 1960s and early 1970s (Newby 2013). In 2013 the total global population was estimated at probably fewer than 300 animals surviving in the wild, distributed unevenly along a narrow, 600-km-long band lying between Termit/Tin Toumma in Niger and the Djourab sand sea in Chad (Newby 2013).&#160;Termit/Tin Toumma appears to be&#160;the last&#160;viable population of Addax in the world, with ground and aerial surveys carried out in 2004&#160;indicating a population of around 200 individuals&#160;(Wacher&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004). Sightings of Addax have declined since 2007. During a field trip carried out in June 2015 by the Sahara Conservation Fund&#160;in&#160;Termit/Tin Toumma, no animals were seen during a thorough survey including all the shade trees, and only footprints of around 25 adults and three calves were found (SCF 2015a)&#160; An aerial survey in March 2016 located only three living animals; remains of Addax and Dorcas Gazelle were also found, left by poachers (Rabeil 2016). The remaining animals are assumed to have been destroyed or dispersed. It is highly probable that there are now &lt;100 Addax left in the wild, and perhaps many fewer. The species is at serious risk of becoming extinct in the wild. <br> </br> The most desert-loving large ungulate, occurring in areas of extreme temperature and aridity (less than 100 mm annually) (Newby 2013). With the exception of truly mountainous areas, Addax have been recorded from all major habitat types in the Sahara, from gravelly and sandy plains, to dune fields, sandy basins and depressions, pans and wadi systems; their preference is for harder, packed sands and flatter areas within and between dune fields that support perennial vegetation (Newby 2013, and references therein).<br/><br/>Addax are nomadic, wandering over large areas in search of grazing.
