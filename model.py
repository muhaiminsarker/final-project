        "Listed as Critically Endangered because the extent of occurrence is less than 100 km<sup>2</sup>&#160;area of occupancy is less than 10 km<sup>2</sup>, all individuals are known from a single location, and the quality of its habitat is declining due largely to invasive exotic grasses. <br> <br/>This species is endemic to Australia, where it formerly ranged from Deniliquin in south-central New South Wales north to Mount Douglas in central Queensland. It is currently restricted to Epping Forest National Park, 120 km north-west of Clermont in central Queensland (Horsup and Johnson 2008). The species' range at Epping Forest National Park covers 500 ha, or less than one sixth of the park (Horsup 2004, Horsup and Johnson 2008). Fossils of this species have been found as far south as Victoria. <br/> This species is listed as a threatened species by Queensland and by Australian law. Its entire range is within the Epping Forest National Park. The Recovery Plan for this species is in its third edition (see Horsup 2004). <br> <br/>The following management actions are underway or planned:<br/><br/>1) Control threats and manage habitat. Predator control – A 20-km predator fence was built in 2002 to prevent a repeat of dingo predation that killed at least 15 wombats in 2000. Monitor and control competitors – The Eastern Grey Kangaroo is the major competitor for food and its numbers are being monitored. Habitat management – Introduced buffel grass is regularly slashed to promote green growth and native species. Fire management – Annual burns are undertaken to reduce fuel loads and promote plant diversity. Supplementary feed and water provisioning – Feed and water stations are now being used by wombats, particularly in dry times (Treby <em>et al.</em> 2007). Permanent management presence on Epping Forest National Park – A volunteer caretaker program ensures twice daily monitoring of the dingo fence.<br/><br/>2) Accurately monitoring wombats. Population censuses – Three censuses each year minimize disturbance and maximize the accuracy of the result and involve collecting wombat hair on sticky tape to extract DNA (see Banks <em>et al.</em> 2003). Burrow monitoring – This is undertaken every six months and monitors activity levels at burrows as an early warning system. Trapping – This was the major means of censusing prior to development of the DNA technique and is now only undertaken when necessary (e.g., to attach radio-collars).<br/><br/>3) Translocation. Locate sites for the establishment of future Northern Hairy-nosed Wombat colonies and develop translocation techniques on Epping Forest National Park.<br/><br/>4) Develop captive techniques on other wombat species. Southern Hairy-nosed Wombats are being used to improve wombat captive breeding and reproductive monitoring techniques. There are no Northern Hairy-nosed Wombats in captivity.<br/><br/>5) Monitor wombat biology and ecology. This includes ongoing studies of diet, reproduction, habitat utilization, behaviour, and burrow architecture.<br/><br/>6) Manage the recovery team. A full-time Recovery Manager is responsible for coordinating and implementing the Recovery Plan, making all relevant information available to recovery personnel, obtaining funding for the Recovery Plan, and undertaking research and monitoring.<br/><br/>This species is listed on CITES Appendix I."
        , "Listed as Extinct because the last confirmed records were in 1924 (Australasian Mammal Assessment Workshop 2008). Despite extensive searching in the 1970s, no Toolache Wallabies were located and there have been no confirmed reports since (Smith and Robinson 2008). There is a report from 1943 (Flannery and Schouten 2001) and reports from the 1950s to the 1970s (Robinson and Young 1983). <br> <br/><p>The Toolache Wallaby was apparently common within a restricted range. By 1910, populations had been reduced to a number of scattered colonies in the area enclosed by Robe, Kingston and Beachport on the South Australian coast, and Naracoorte and Penola further to the east, near Mt Gambier. By 1924 only one small group was known to survive on Konetta Station, about halfway between Robe and Penola. An attempt was made to transfer some of the population to a sanctuary on Kangaroo Island, but this failed. The last known survivor died in captivity in Robe in 1939 (Flannery and Kendall 1990).</p>The Toolache Wallaby occupied open country. Its preferred habitat was grassland at the edge of woodlands of Brown Stringybark <em>Eucalyptus baxteri</em> with heathy understorey. Such areas were flat or gently undulating, becoming swampy in winter with depressions filled by a matted growth of Black Rush (Chaffy Saw-sedge) <em>Gahnia filum</em> or among tussocks of tall coarse Cutting Grass <em>Gahnia trifida</em> and Kangaroo Grass <em>Themeda</em> sp. Small areas of slightly higher ground carried sparse stands of Drooping She-oak <em>Allocasuarina verticillata</em>, which were used for shelter. Toolache Wallabies had an unusual gait, but were capable of high speed for long periods (Robinson and Young 1983)."
        , "Listed as Endangered as standardized surveys indicate that the global Tasmanian Devil population has declined by more than 60% in the last 10 years (Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006, McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). Research indicates that an invariably fatal infectious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD), is responsible for the decline. DFTD currently occurs across the majority (estimated 60%) of the geographic range of the devil and continues to spread at variable rates (depending on location) in the range of 7-50 km/y (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). Mark-recapture data from the most intensively studied population at Freycinet National Park estimated a decline in total population size of 30% in the first 3 years after disease arrival, with an annual decline in the adult (2+) population of 50% (Lachish <em>et al</em>. 2007). Both projections from these observed results and an epidemiological model predict local extinction at this site within 10 years of disease arrival (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). At a second site, Mt William, where DFTD signs were first reported 10 years ago, mark-recapture methods estimate a decline of 90% over 10 years. There is no evidence either of a reduction in disease prevalence or of the rate of population decline as devil abundance reduces. On current information, we therefore project at least 90% population decline over the next 10 years across the 60% of the devil's distribution currently occupied by disease, with at least a 100 km extension of the disease distribution. Together, this would amount to a further decline (in excess of the 50% already observed) of at least 70% in the next 10 years, with widespread local extinctions. Whilst the cause of decline (DFTD) is understood, it has not ceased and its effects are not reversible with current knowledge. <br> <br/>The Tasmanian Devil is found throughout mainland Tasmania, Australia, an area of 64,030 km<sup>2</sup>. The species disappeared from the Australian mainland 430 +/-160 years ago (Archer and Baynes 1972), possibly through competition with dingos (Guiler 1982) and Aboriginals (Johnson and Wroe 2003). Tasmanian Devils were introduced to the small offshore Badger Island in the mid-1990s, but as of August 2007 all Tasmanian Devils were thought to have been removed from this island (N.Mooney unpubl.).<br/><br/>Tasmanian Devils were present on Bruny Island (a large inshore island off south-eastern Tasmania) in the early 1800s, but there are no confirmed records from after 1900. Tasmanian Devils also occur on Robbins Island, a large inshore island to the north-west, semi-connected to mainland Tasmania. <br/> Tasmanian Devils are found throughout Tasmania, in all native terrestrial habitats, as well as in forestry plantations and pasture, from sea level to all but the highest peaks of Tasmania (Jones and Rose 1996, Jones and Barmuta 2000). Densities are lowest in the buttongrass plains of the south-west and, prior to Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) emergence, highest in the dry and mixed sclerophyll forests and coastal heath of Tasmania's eastern half and north-west coast (Jones and Rose 1996). Open forests and woodlands are preferred, while tall or dense wet forests are avoided (Jones and Rose 1996; Jones and Barmuta 2000). The highest population densities are found in mixed patches of grazing land and forest or woodland. Relative trapping success and spool-and-line tracking indicate that Tasmanian Devils travel through lowlands, saddles and along creeks, avoiding steep slopes and rocky areas, and favouring predictably rich sources of food such as bush/pasture mosaics on farms, carcass and rubbish dumps, and roads (Jones and Barmuta 2000, Pukk 2005; N. Mooney and D. Pemberton pers. comm.). Tasmanian Devils are able to reach very high densities, even in suboptimal habitat, if sufficient food and den sites are available. The 14 km² Badger Island at one time supported 120 Tasmanian Devils.<br/><br/>Seabird colonies, such as Short-tailed Shearwaters (or muttonbirds, <em>Puffinus tenuirostris</em>), are thought to have traditionally been a preferred habitat for Tasmanian Devils, providing an important food source. These are now much reduced along the east coast, but some sites remain along the west coast (D. Pemberton pers. comm.).<br/><br/>"
        , "This cryptic species endemic to Australia was rediscovered in western Queensland in 2013 after a 78-year period without a confirmed record. Since then, at least two additional populations and areas have been identified in Western Australia. Population size, trends, and geographic range are still very poorly understood. The population size has been placed in the band of 50-249 mature individuals, and for this reason it is classified as Endangered. <br> <br/> <p>In an attempt to explain widespread but scattered records, the species was previously thought to be nomadic or to have very large home ranges (Higgins 1999). However, limited radio- and GPS-tracking carried out by Murphy <em>et al</em>. (2017b) implies that the species is more sedentary than these speculations suggest. Movement of two tracked birds remained within an area of approximately 70 km<sup>2</sup>. Individuals moved approximately 30 km per night within a radius of less than 10 km from roosting locations.<br/>Tracked birds moved from their roosts in <em>Triodia</em>&#160;(spinifex) hummocks to feeding sites in more diverse habitats marked by large-seeded grass and forb species. Physiological modelling suggests that the species may need to visit standing water, especially during summer (Kearney <em>et al. </em>2016). <br> </br> The bird GPS-tracked by Murphy&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>(2017b) only visited a permanent water source once. However, a considerable amount of rain fell during the tracking period, and so ephemeral water sources were likely to be available. During winter, Night Parrots may satisfy water requirements from their diet, which may include succulent plants, such as <em>Sclerolaena </em>spp (Kearney&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016).<br/>Most habitat records are of <em>Triodia </em>grasslands and/or chenopod shrublands (Garnett <em>et al</em>. 2011) in the arid and semi-arid zones, and Higgins (1999) listed <em>Astrebla </em>spp. (Mitchell grass), shrubby samphire and chenopod associations, scattered trees and shrubs, <em>Acacia aneura</em> (Mulga) woodland, treeless areas and bare gibber as associated with sightings of the species. S. Murphy (pers. comm. in TSSC 2016) recorded a similar range of habitats used or traversed by individuals in southwestern Queensland: Cretaceous sandstone, claystone, and siltstone residuals; either dominated by <em>Triodia longiceps</em> on slopes and margins of duricrust plateaus or with <em>Sclerolaena </em>spp., <em>Maireana </em>spp. (Saltbush spp.), <em>Ptilotus </em>spp. (Mulla Mulla spp.), and small areas of <em>T. longiceps</em>; with occasional watercourses with <em>Acacia cambagei </em>(stinking gidgee).&#160;The habitat of the southwestern Queensland population is naturally fragmented, and is unlikely to promote fire behaviour that results in most habitat in this area being burned by one fire event (Murphy 2015, S. Murphy pers. comm. 2016 in TSSC 2016).<br> <br/> Recent and historical accounts of nests describe a slight depression in a cavity at the end of a tunnel built into a&#160;<em>Triodia</em>&#160;hummock (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2017, Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2017a). Clutch size is reported as 2-4 eggs (Murphy <em>et al</em>. 2017a, Collar <em>et al</em>. 2019).</p> <p></p>The causes of the assumed decline of the species are “essentially guesswork” (Garnett <em>et al. </em>2011). Blyth (1996) proposed a list of threats considered realistic in the absence of direct evidence. Threats to the species are likely to vary across its range and might include predation by feral cats and foxes; soil disturbance, erosion and loss caused by herbivores (including livestock and over-abundant native and feral herbivores);&#160;degradation of habitat around water points by herbivores; competition for food by herbivores; fire;&#160;psittacine beak and feather disease, avian pox, and other diseases;&#160;illegal collection of birds or eggs;&#160;disturbance from bird-watching activities; fences; and reduction in water availability through over-use of waterholes by camels and&#160;reduced waterhole maintenance (TSSC 2016). Biophysical modelling suggests that predicted temperature increases under various climate change scenarios would increase the species's dependence on free-standing water dramatically (Kearney&#160;<em>et al. </em>2016). Thus, climate change, interacting with the spatial configuration of water points and habitats, and the concentration of feral predators at water points, may become a serious future threat.<p></p>"
        ,"A recent extensive global phylogeny of Red Foxes that included ~1,000 samples from across the species range found that Red Foxes originated in the Middle East, then radiated out, and that Red Foxes in North America are genetically distinct and probably merit recognition as a distinct species (<em>Vulpes fulva</em>) (Statham <em>et al</em>. 2014)<em>.</em> <br> </br> The Red Fox has the widest geographical range of any member of the order Carnivora (covering nearly 70 million km²) being distributed across the entire northern hemisphere from the Arctic Circle to southern North America, Europe, North Africa, the Asiatic steppes, India, and Japan. Not found in Iceland, the Arctic islands, or some parts of Siberia.&#160;Red Foxes are generally considered extinct in the Republic of Korea where there have been several mammal surveys in recent years (including the DMZ) that have not shown any evidence of foxes.<br/><br/>The European subspecies was introduced into the eastern United States (where they were relatively scarce and the Gray Fox <em>Urocyon cinereoargenteus </em>common)&#160;and Canada in the 17th century for fox hunting; however, there appears to be limited evidence for any meaningful mixing of introduced European foxes and those in North America (i.e., no Eurasian haplotypes found in foxes sampled; Statham <em>et al</em>. 2012). The species was also introduced to Australia in the 1800s, and to Tasmania in the late 1990s (although there is evidence that an eradication campaign for Red Foxes on Tasmania has proved effective; see Caley <em>et al</em>. 2015). Elsewhere introduced to the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) and to the Isle of Man (UK), although they never properly established on the Isle of Man (Reynolds and Short 2003) and may subsequently have disappeared. <br> </br>Red Foxes have been recorded in habitats as diverse as tundra, desert (though not extreme deserts) and forest, as well as in city centres (including London, Paris, Stockholm, etc.). Natural habitat is dry, mixed landscape, with abundant edge of scrub and woodland. They are also abundant on moorlands, mountains (even above the treeline, known to cross alpine passes), sand dunes and farmland from sea level to 4,500 m. In the United Kingdom, they generally prefer mosaic patchworks of scrub, woodland and farmland. Red Foxes flourish particularly well in urban areas. They are most common in residential suburbs consisting of privately owned, low-density housing and are less common where industry, commerce or council rented housing predominates (Harris and Smith 1987). In many habitats, foxes appear to be closely associated with people, even thriving in intensive agricultural areas. <br> </br>Threats to this species are highly localized and include habitat degradation, loss, and fragmentation, and exploitation, and direct and indirect persecution. For example, a regional red list assessment in Mongolia (Clark and Munkhbat&#160;2006) classified the species as Near Threatened mainly due to overhunting, while in South Korea, Red Foxes have experienced declines due to habitat loss and poaching and is generally considered extinct (Yu <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, their general versatility and eclectic diet are likely to ensure their persistence despite changes in landscape and prey base. Culling may be able to reduce numbers well below carrying capacity in large regions (Heydon and Reynolds 2000), but no known situations exist where this currently threatens species persistence on any geographical scale. Red Foxes have caused considerable damage where they have been introduced; their impacts on Australian fauna has been particularly well documented; control takes place by setting baits impregnated with 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate)., conservationmeasures: <strong>Legislation</strong><br/>Not listed in CITES Appendices at species level. However, the subspecies <em>griffithi</em>, <em>montana</em> and <em>pusilla</em> (=<em>leucopus</em>) are listed on CITES – Appendix III (India).&#160;<br/><br/>Widely regarded as a pest and unprotected. Most countries and/or states where trapping or hunting occurs have regulated closed versus open seasons and restrictions on methods of capture. In the European Union, Canada, and the Russian Federation, trapping methods are regulated under an agreement on international trapping standards between these countries, which was signed in 1997. Other countries are signatories to ISO/DIS 10990-5.2 animal (mammal) traps, which specifies standards for trap testing.<br/><br/>In Europe and North America, hunting traditions and/or legislation impose closed seasons on fox hunting. In the United Kingdom and a few other European countries, derogation from these provisions allows breeding season culling for pest-control purposes. Here, traditional hunting ethics encouraging restrained use may be at odds with harder hitting pest-control ambitions. This apparent conflict between different interest groups is particularly evident in the UK, where fox control patterns are highly regionally variable (Macdonald&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). In some regions, principal lowland areas where classical mounted hunting operates, limited economic analyses suggest that the principal motive for these communal fox hunts is as a sport – the number killed is small compared with the cost of the hunting. In these regions, most anthropogenic mortality is by individual farmers shooting foxes. The mounted communal hunts do exhibit restraint – hunting takes place for a limited season, and for a prescribed number of days per week. Elsewhere, in upland regions, communal hunting by foot with guns and dogs may make economic sense, depending on the number of lambs lost to foxes (data on this is poor), and also on the current value of lost lambs. This type of fox hunting may also be perceived as a sport by its participants.<br/><strong><br/></strong><strong>Presence in protected areas</strong><br/>Present in most temperate-subarctic conservation areas.<br/><br/><strong>Presence in captivity</strong><br/>In addition to fur farms, Red Foxes are widely kept in small wildlife parks and zoos, but there appears to be no systematic data on their breeding success. Being extremely shy they are often poor exhibits."
        , "Listed as Endangered because of a serious population decline, estimated to exceed 50% over the last 10 years, and one that is projected to continue at a similar rate over the next 10 years based on the effects of habitat destruction and/or degradation, cane toads, and introduced predators. <br> </br> The Northern Quoll occurs in the northern parts of Australia. Historically, it occurred in northern Australia from Pilbara to south-east Queensland, extending inland as far south as Alexandria. More recently, there has been substantial decline in southern and eastern Queensland and the Cape York Peninsula. The Northern Quoll has apparently disappeared from most or all of the lower rainfall former range in the Northern Territory and south-east and south-west Kimberley. A substantial decline has also occurred in Pilbara (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). The species has been recorded from Groote Eylandt and the nearby North-east Island, Marchinbar Island (in the Wessel group), Inglis Island (in the English Company Islands group) and Vanderlin Island (Sir Edward Pellew group). It has also been recently translocated to Astell and Pobassoo Islands in the English Company island group (Woinarski 2005). This species occurs up to around 1,300 m asl. <br> <br/>The Northern Quoll occurs in a range of habitats including Eucalyptus open forest, monsoon rainforest, and savannah woodlands. The species is most abundant (and apparently with less fluctuations) in rocky environments. In north Queensland, it is most common in coastal and/or high altitude rocky areas and in drier habitats of upland tablelands (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). This species is a generalist, as it occurs in a wide range of habitats and its diet consists of a variety of invertebrates and small vertebrates (Woinarski 2005). The Northern Quoll shelters in hollow logs, rock crevices, caves, and tree hollows (Woinarski 2005). It is mostly a ground-dwelling species, but is also an adept climber (Woinarski 2005). <br> <br/> Current threats are uncertain, but the species may be vulnerable to disease, possibly related to the presence of cats. Cats and dogs are known to kill individuals, although they apparently do not like to eat them. Predation is the main cause of mortality in some areas (exacerbated by changes in fire regimes that result in more frequent burning), particularly woodland and forest habitats (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996). There have been recent substantial population declines in the Iron Range (Queensland), Cape York Peninsula, and the top end of the Northern Territory associated with the spread of cane toads and land-use changes. For instance, major declines to regional extinction have been reported for Northern Quolls following cane toad invasion on Cape York Peninsula (Burnett 1997). Northern Quolls appear to be particularly susceptible to the poison of cane toads, and are killed when they attempt to kill or consume the toads (Woinarski 2005). The species has also disappeared from coastal lowland areas in north Queensland following agricultural and urban development (Maxwell <em>et al.</em> 1996)."
        , "This species has an extremely large range, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the range size criterion (Extent of Occurrence &lt;20,000 km<sup>2</sup> combined with a declining or fluctuating range size, habitat extent/quality, or population size and a small number of locations or severe fragmentation). The population trend is not known, but the population is not believed to be decreasing sufficiently rapidly to approach the thresholds under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern. <br> </br> <strong>Behaviour</strong> <br> </br> All populations of this species undergo post-breeding dispersive movements (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Populations breeding in the tropics are sedentary (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) or partially migratory (in relation to rainfall) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), whereas Palearctic and Nearctic populations are migratory (Flint <em>et al.</em> 1984, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The timing of the breeding season varies geographically (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) although temperate breeders tend to nest in the spring and summer (e.g. April to July) and tropical breeders nest in the part of the rain cycle when food becomes maximally available (this may be during the rains or in the dry season) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species typically breeds in colonies of tens, hundreds or even a thousand pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), sometimes with other species (e.g. 450 pairs in a mixed colony of over 3,000 nests in Australia) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Some populations also show a tendency to breed solitarily or in small groups (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Outside of the breeding season the species may feed solitarily (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) or in small loose groups (Marchant and Higgins 1990) (e.g. of 12-50 individuals) (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), although flocks of hundreds or more individuals may form where food is abundant (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The species is a diurnal feeder (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) but is most active at dawn and dusk (although in coastal environments it feeding habits are determined by tidal stages) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), and roosts at night in trees (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) alongside lakes or rivers or in mangroves, often with other species (Langrand 1990). <br> </br><strong>Habitat</strong> <br> </br>The species inhabits all kinds of inland and coastal wetlands (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) although it is mainly found along the coast in the winter (e.g. in the Palearctic Region) (Snow and Perrins 1998) or during droughts (e.g. in Australia) (Marchant and Higgins 1990). It frequents river margins, lakes shores, marshes, flood-plains (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), oxbows, streams (Snow and Perrins 1998), damp meadows (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), rice-fields, drainage ditches (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), aquaculture ponds, reservoirs (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and sewage works (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Hockey <em>et al.</em> 2005) inland, and the shallows of salt-lakes (Marchant and Higgins 1990), saltpans, mudflats, coastal swamps, mangroves (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), saltmarshes, seagrass flats, offshore coral reefs, lagoons (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and estuaries when in coastal locations (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <br> </br><strong>Diet</strong> <br> </br> In aquatic habitats its diet consists of fish, amphibians, snakes, aquatic insects and crustaceans although in drier habitats terrestrial insects, lizards, small birds and mammals are more commonly taken (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is constructed from sticks (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and vegetation (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) and is normally positioned over water at a height of 1-15 m (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) in reedbeds, bamboos (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), bushes, trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) (e.g. willow <em>Salix</em> spp.)<strong>, </strong>mangroves (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and other plants near water or on islands in sites that are protected from ground predators (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species usually nests colonially in single- or mixed-species groups where nests may be less than 1 m apart or touching, although they are usually placed more spread out in reedbeds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Breeding pairs may also reuse nests from previous years (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). <strong>Management information </strong>Breeding site conservation should include colony protection, control of disturbance and vegetation management, and the conservation of feeding areas should include the management of hydrology, salt intrusion, contaminants and disturbance (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). An artificial island nesting site created in the Camargue, France succeeded in attracting nesting pairs to the area (Hafner 2000). <br> </br> The species is threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss (Marchant and Higgins 1990, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) for example through drainage, grazing, clearing, burning, increased salinity, groundwater extraction and invasion by exotic plants (Marchant and Higgins 1990). Breeding colonies in Madagascar may be declining due to egg and chick gathering from colonies by local people (Langrand 1990, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and the species previously suffered from intense persecution for the plume trade (this is no longer a threat) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992)."
        , "The two species of Elephant Seals, <em>Mirounga leonina</em> and <em>M. angustirostris</em>, share many similarities in appearance and behaviour and differ primarily in their range and in the timing of their terrestrial periods ashore (Bonner 1989, Ling and Bryden 1992). Speciation is thought to have occurred approximately one million years ago (Hoelzel <em>et al</em>. 1993). <br> </br>Southern Elephant Seals are the largest of all pinnipeds with adult males reaching masses of two to four tons and lengths of up to 4.5 m. They show considerable sexual dimorphism, with adult females only reaching masses of 400-900 kg and average lengths of 2.8 m. Newborn pups weigh between 40 and 46 kg (Laws 1993). Females first haul out to pup at ages of three to six years, and males typically breed for the first time at six to ten years of age (Laws 1956,&#160;Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962a, Jones 1981,&#160;McCann 1981,&#160;Pistorius&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2001,&#160;Kirkman <em>et al.</em> 2004). At Marion Island, less than 5% of females survived beyond 13 years of age, and less than 5% of males beyond 10 years of age (de Bruyn 2009). Longevity of 23 years has been recorded for adult females at Macquarie Island (Hindell and Little 1988).<br/><br/>Southern Elephant Seals undergo an annual double migration between foraging grounds and isolated haulout sites, at which they are born and where they breed in the austral spring, moult in the austral summer, and as immatures haulout in the winter (Bartholomew and Hubbs 1960, Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962b, Hindell and Burton 1988). Southern Elephant Seals are predominantly marine. Adult females spend more than 85% of each year at sea while adult males spend less than 80% (Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962a, Hindell and Burton 1988, McIntyre <em>et al.</em> 2010). Their foraging grounds may be located over 5,000 km from their terrestrial haulout sites (Bester and Pansegrouw 1992, Jonker and Bester 1998,&#160;Campagna&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999,&#160;Bailleul&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007).<br/><br/>Southern Elephant Seals spend most of their at-sea time foraging in association with frontal systems, currents and shifting marginal ice-edge zones. Studies of foraging sites suggest that they are sensitive to fine-scale variation in bathymetry and ocean properties (sea-ice concentration and sea temperature profiles) (Bailleul <em>et al.</em> 2007, Biuw <em>et al.</em> 2010). Southern Elephant Seals are prodigious divers. Dive depth and duration vary during the year and between the sexes, but mostly range from 200 to 700 m deep and from 20 to just over 30 minutes in duration (Biuw <em>et al.</em> 2010, McIntyre <em>et al.</em> 2010). Both sexes spend over 65% of their lives below 100 m. The maximum record dive depth is 2,133 m for an adult male (McIntyre <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>The diet varies between populations and seasons. It consist primarily of myctophid and notothenid fish and squid (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1999,&#160;Piatkowski&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2002,&#160;Bradshaw&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003,&#160;van den Hoff&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2003,&#160;Cherel <em>et al.</em> 2008, Newland <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>Four types of terrestrial periods are experienced over the course of their lives: the breeding, moult and winter haulouts, and the natal terrestrial period. The mating system is mate-defense polygyny. Breeding seasons are highly synchronized (Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962b, Laws 1956, McCann 1981,&#160;Bonner 1989). Adult females spend approximately a month ashore during the breeding season, while adult males may spend one to three months ashore. During this time adult females will haul out in large aggregations that may contain up to a thousand animals (Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962a,&#160;Bonner 1989). Some three to seven days after females come ashore they give birth to a single pup, which they will suckle for some three weeks. Mating takes place shortly before the pup is weaned and the adult female returns to the sea a few days later. Breeding aggregations are ephemeral, and do not last beyond the breeding season. Access to all females in one breeding aggregation is defended by a dominant adult male. In larger breeding aggregations, subdominant males also gain access to females (Laws 1956,&#160;Carrick <em>et al.</em> 1962a, McCann 1981).<br/><br/>Killer Whales are the primary predators of Southern Elephant Seals (Reisinger <em>et al.</em> 2011) but Leopard Seals are also known to take pups (Gwyn 1953). <br> </br> <p>Southern Elephant Seals face few threats and conflicts today, since they live far from human population centres and have minimal interactions with commercial fisheries. Intensive fishing could, however, deplete important prey stocks (Hanchet <em>et al</em>. 2003). The possible effects of global climate change on Southern Elephant Seals are not well known but such changes may negatively impact prey populations or change marine habitat (Learmonth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2012). It is also possible that a reduction in sea ice due to climate change may benefit Southern Elephant Seals (van den Hoff <em>et al</em>. 2014). Southern Elephant Seals that haul out at mainland sites could come in contact with domestic and wild animals and be exposed to a variety of diseases including morbilliviruses (Lavigne and Schmitz 1990).</p>"

        "This species is listed as Near Threatened because it is projected to undergo a moderately rapid population decline over the next three generations owing to the projected effects of climate change. However, it should be noted that there is considerable uncertainty over future climatic changes and how these will impact the species. <br><br/>This species is marine and pelagic, feeding mainly on fish in Antarctic waters (although krill and cephalopods can be important dietary components). It breeds almost exclusively on fast ice near the coast or on the coast itself, sometimes up to as much as 200 km from the open sea. Only one known colony occurs wholly on land (Robertson <em>et al.</em> 2014), while a small number uses available land for parts of their breeding cycle. Four colonies are known to locate at least temporarily onto the top of ice shelves (Fretwell <em>et al. </em>2014). It has an annual breeding cycle, arriving at colonies in late March to April, and lays eggs in May/ June. Chicks fledge in December/January (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <br> </br><p>The species is threatened by the effects of projected climate change, primarily through ongoing and future decreases in sea ice concentration and thickness, as affected by wind speed and persistence, as well as changes in other climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation (Ainley<em> et al.</em> 2010). The decrease of a colony on Emperor Island from c.150 pairs in<em> </em>the 1970s to fewer than 20 pairs by 1999 (at which time it occurred on land), with the apparent disappearance of the colony by 2009, has been linked to a decline in seasonal sea ice duration, particularly in seasonal stable ice suitable for nesting (Trathan<em> et al. </em>2011). In recent years, Antarctic sea ice increased in extent, especially in East Antarctica. In June 2014, the extent was over 2 million km<sup>2</sup> above the long-term average. Increased run-off of fresh water from melting glaciers in West Antarctica and strengthening southerly winds in the Ross Sea region were suggested to decrease sea surface temperatures (Fan <em>et al.</em> 2014). Alternatively, increases in the wind strength of westerly winds may increase sea ice extent. However, Ferreira <em>et al.</em> (2015) indicated that this could be a short-term response only (c.20 years), and that over the long-term, the effect will still be a decrease in sea ice extent. The Antarctic continues to change, hence so too does Emperor Penguin habitat. In 1994-2003, the loss of ice from ice shelves around the continent was estimated to occur at a rate of 25±64 km<sup>3</sup>/yr. From 2003 to 2012, ice loss increased to 310±74 km<sup>3</sup>/yr and in West Antarctica, the fastest warming part of Antarctica, ice loss increased by 70% (Paolo <em>et al. </em>2015). In the much longer term, Emperor Penguin habitat is likely to deteriorate to a point where suitable locations occur only in restricted refugia or, in the worst case scenario, may be completely unavailable (Jenouvrier <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Disturbance is a threat in some areas, with problems to colonies caused by the proximity to scientific bases and aircraft movements (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Sites visited by tourists collectively account for a very small percentage of the global population (J. Croxall<em> in litt. </em>2017), but the impacts of tourism on breeding penguins remain uncertain (Trathan <em>et al. </em>2011). Other human impacts potentially include disturbance from researchers, construction of new science facilities and Antarctic krill fisheries. Fisheries for Antarctic Silverfish <em>Pleuragramma antarcticum </em>could potentially be developed in the future. Harvesting of silverfish and krill could pose a threat, if management does not adequately take into account the needs of species that feed upon these species. Oil spills may also be important at local scales. Protection of habitat at sea is important, with the designation of appropriate protection for transit, foraging and rafting areas at sea.</p>"
        , "This species qualifies as Vulnerable because the global population appears to have declined rapidly over the last three generations (36 years). The primary drivers of declines are uncertain but could include climatic variation and competition for food from commercial fisheries.<br/><p></p> <br> </br> <p><span><em>Eudyptes chrysolophus</em><span><em> </em>breeds in at least&#160;258 colonies at c. 55 breeding sites (Crossin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), including southern <strong>Chile</strong>, the <strong>Falkland Islands<em> </em></strong>(<strong>Malvinas</strong>), <strong>South Georgia</strong> (<strong>Georgia del Sur</strong>) and the South Sandwich Islands (Islas Sandwich del Sur), the South Orkney and South Shetland Islands, Bouvet Island (<strong>to Norway</strong>), Prince Edward and Marion Islands (<strong>South Africa</strong>), Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Islands (<strong>French Southern Territories</strong>), Heard and McDonald Islands (<strong>to Australia</strong>) and very locally on the Antarctic Peninsula.</span></p><p>Important populations exist at Isles Crozet (2.2 million pairs, including 1 million on Iles des Pingouins), Kerguelen (1.8 million pairs), Heard Island (1 million pairs), South Georgia (1 million pairs) and Marion Island (290,000 pairs). The population in the Patagonian Shelf region is estimated at 25,000 breeding pairs (Oehler <em>et al.</em> 2008, Kirkwood <em>et al.</em> 2007, Crossin <em>et al.</em> 2013). The Falkland Islands (Malvinas) population is estimated at no more than 1000 individuals (Stanworth <em>Pers. Comm.</em>). The rest of the population is contained in Chile in at least 12 known colonies. Diego Ramirez is the largest colony with 15,600 pairs (Kirkwood <em>et al.</em> 2007).</p><p>Geolocation tracking during winter revealed that individuals from Kerguelen showed strong inter-annual fidelity to their wintering sites. They spent most of their time in a narrow latitudinal band (47-49 degrees S) within the central Indian Ocean (70-110 degrees E), corresponding oceanographically to the Polar Frontal Zone (Bost&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009; Thiebot&#160;<em>et al.</em>2011). In contrast, individuals from South Georgia spend most of their time widely distributed across the Scotia Sea during winter (Ratcliffe&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).</p><p></p> <br> </br><p>Climate change is an important potential candidate for explaining recent declines. Large-scale environmental changes, particularly those related to sea temperatures could be contributing to habitat loss, indirect ecosystem effects, direct species mortality and reduced reproductive success, but the nature and level of impacts remain unclear as there may be divergent responses in different populations; climate was found to be have potentially positive effects in the short to medium term for the population studied at Bird Island, South Georgia, whereas changes to predation dynamics appear to be the main factor driving declines (Horswill <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2016).<br/><br/>Historical and continuing prey competition with fur seals <em>Arctocephalus</em> spp. at South Georgia is considered to have substantially contributed to declines noted over the past several decades, with the fur seal population increasing from an estimated 30,000 to c. 3 million in the past few decades (Barlow <em>et al.</em> 2002). Recovery of fur seals at the Prince Edward Islands could increase competition for prey as well as causing increased predation pressure on penguins (Dyer and Crawford 2015). Increasing seal populations could also block access to breeding sites thereby inhibiting colony growth, as demonstrated on Bouvet Island (Isaksen <em>et al.</em> 1997). In the South Georgia population, predation appears to be of secondary concern with relatively few fur seals predating penguins and local penguin declines starting well in advance of increases in seal predation (J. Croxall in litt. 2017). Giant Petrels <em>Macronectes</em> spp. contribute to predation pressures on immature penguins, targeting them in the vulnerable fledgling phase (Horswill <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p> </p><p>Commercial fisheries could represent a threat through incidental capture and resource competition. Long-line fisheries at winter feeding grounds have inflicted limited bycatch mortality on Macaroni Penguins (Dyer and Crawford 2015) and harvesting of Antarctic krill could reduce food availability if management does not adequately take into account the dietary needs of the species. Invasive mammals including cats, mice and rabbits are present on a number of sub-Antarctic islands but their current impact on the species is thought to be negligible (Crossin <em>et al.</em> 2013). Breeding colonies on Marion Island have previously shown declines following outbreaks of avian cholera and other unknown diseases (Cooper <em>et al. </em>2009). Human impacts potentially also include disturbance from tourists, scientists, construction of new science facilities and fisheries. Oil spills may also be important at local scales. Protection of habitat on land and at sea remains important, with the designation of appropriate protection for transit, foraging and rafting areas at sea.</p><p></p>"
        , "<p>This species is listed as Endangered as data from South Georgia (Georgias del Sur), which holds around half the global population, indicate a very rapid rate of decline of the world population over three generations (90 years), even if colonies lacking trend information are assumed to be stable. The major driver of declines is likely to be incidental mortality in longline fisheries.</p><p></p> <p></p> <br> </br><p><strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is normally a biennial breeder, although 5.4% and 1% of successful breeders on Marion Island and Bird Island (South Georgia) respectively, breed in the following season. Birds return to colonies between late September and early October, laying occurs in October and chicks hatch by December. Chicks fledge from April to May. Immatures return to breeding colonies at the earliest at 3 years of age, but generally at 6 or 7 years old. First breeding can be as early as 7 years, but the average on Campbell Island is 13.5 years old, and the modal age on South Georgia is 12 years old. Grey-headed Albatrosses feed by surface-seizing but can also dive to six metres (<a>Huin and Prince 1997</a>). Substantial segregation in foraging areas is apparent for male and female Grey-headed Albatrosses during incubation at South Georgia, with males travelling on average further than females (Phillips <em>et al.</em> 2004). At Iles Kerguelen, Campbell Island and South Georgia (Islas Georgias del Sur), the species is principally an oceanic forager, concentrating its foraging in the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone, but in years of low food availability, chick-rearing birds from South Georgia (Islas Georgias del Sur) increase the proportion of time spent in Antarctic shelf-slope waters. Prey biogeography also indicates some neritic foraging around Iles Kerguelen and Campbell Island during chick rearing (ACAP 2009). At Marion Island, incubating birds foraged in the Sub-tropical Frontal Zone and the Subantarctic Zone in association with mesoscale eddies, whereas during chick-rearing, foraging was concentrated in the Subantarctic and Polar Frontal Zones to the south-west of the island, also in association with eddies (Nel <em>et al. </em>2000,<em> </em>2001).&#160;<strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding </em>This species breeds on steep slopes or cliffs, that are generally covered with tussock-grass.&#160;<strong>Diet </strong>The diet varies with locality and year, mainly consisting of cephalopods and fish, but crustaceans, carrion and lampreys are locally important (Prince 1980, Cherel <em>et al.</em> 2002, Xavier <em>et al.</em> 2003, Arata <em>et al.</em> 2004). It actively scavenges longline baits.</p> <br> </br><p>Incidental capture by commercial longline fisheries represents a major threat to this species. In Australian waters, up to c. 400 individuals (over 80% juvenile) were killed annually in 1989-1995 by Japanese longliners (Gales <em>et al.</em> 1998). Despite mainly foraging over oceanic waters, the species also interacts with longline fisheries targeting Patagonian Toothfish <em>Dissostichus eleginoides</em> in shelf areas (ACAP 2009). In the Indian Ocean, illegal or unregulated fishing for Patagonian Toothfish killed an estimated 10,000-20,000 albatrosses (mainly this species) in 1997 and 1998 (CCAMLR 1997, CCAMLR 1998). Due to its circumpolar distribution, <em>T. chrysostoma</em> is potentially vulnerable to Southern Ocean pelagic fisheries worldwide (with the exception of the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone; G. Taylor <em>in litt.</em> 2008). The extensive use of the Subtropical Convergence and Sub-Antarctic Zones by incubating birds from Marion Island, especially females, bring them into contact with intense Southern Bluefin Tuna <em>Thunnus maccoyii</em> longline fishing activity in international waters (40-45°) (ACAP 2009). In addition, bycatch of Grey-headed Albatross has also been recorded in the poorly regulated small-scale longline operations off the coast of Peru, suggesting that mortality in these operations is also significant (Mangel 2012). </p> <p>Long-term declines on Campbell began well before local longline fishery development, and appear to be caused by environmental factors, possibly rising sea-surface temperatures resulting in food shortages. Pardo <em>et al</em>. (2017) demonstrated that adult mortality from bycatch was exacerbated by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and associated reductions in food availability, indicating that periodic temperature extremes are at least contributing to a significant population decline.</p> Another threat is posed by introduced House Mice <em>Mus musculus</em>. On Marion Island, up to 5% of Grey-headed Albatross chicks are killed by mice each year and the rate is likely to increase unless mice are eradicated (Dilley <em>et al.</em> 2016).<p></p>"
        "<p> </p><p>The Humpback Whale is a cosmopolitan species with a large range covering all oceans. The current global population is estimated at 135,000 and the mature population at about 84,000, which is higher than the level of three generations ago. This is true of the global population as well as the three main regional populations individually – North Pacific, North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere. The species does not, therefore, qualify for a Red List threatened category, and is listed as Least Concern. The Arabian Sea subpopulation appears to be isolated, is very small, and is listed separately as Endangered (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p> <p></p> <br> </br><p> </p><p> </p><p>With few exceptions, such as the Arabian Sea population, Humpback Whales undertake long migrations between breeding grounds in tropical coastal waters in winter to feeding grounds in middle and high latitudes (Clapham 2018).<br/> <br/> In the Southern Hemisphere, they appear to feed mainly in the antarctic and subantarctic, where the diet consists almost exclusively of euphausiids (Krill, <em>Euphausia superba</em>) (Mackintosh 1970), although some feeding has been observed in the Benguela Current ecosystem on the migration route west of South Africa (Best <em>et al</em>. 1995); suspected prey species in that region are euphausiids (<em>E. lucens</em><em>)</em> and amphipods (<em>Themisto gaudichaudii</em><em>)</em>. Some Humpback Whales feed in summer in mid-latitude (41°-44°S) Chilean waters (Hucke-Gaete<em> et al</em>. 2013) <br/> <br/> Few data on diet in other areas are available. Humpback Whales caught off Newfoundland and Labrador in the 1950s and 1960s were consuming mainly Capelin (<em>Mallotus villotus</em>) (Mitchell 1973). Those caught off California in the early 20th century were eating mainly euphausiids and sardines (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 1997). Humpback Whales caught in the northern North Pacific in the 1950s were feeding mainly on euphausiids and fish (Nemoto 1959). In areas of Alaska and the North Atlantic, Humpback Whales have also been observed feeding in coordinated fashion on schools of Pacific Herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>), Sand Lance (<em>Ammodytes</em> spp.), and (more rarely) Mackerel (<em>Scomber scombrus</em>), herding the school together with bubble nets, clouds or curtains (Hain <em>et al</em>. 1982).<br/> <br/> The timing of acquisition of tooth rake marks attributable to Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) indicates that Humpback Whale calves, but usually not subadults and adults, are subject to predation (Mehta <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p> <p></p> <p></p> <br> </br> <p>Although modern commercial whaling seriously depleted all Humpback populations, some of which had already been reduced by pre-modern whaling, the species has demonstrated remarkable resilience, and there have been substantial increases in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere. Humpback whales have been legally protected from commercial whaling worldwide since 1966, and there have been few catches since 1968. It is unclear whether there has been any recovery in the small, isolated population in the Arabian Sea.<br/><br/>Today, small numbers only are taken for local consumption in Greenland (up to 10 annually) and the island of Bequia (St. Vincent and the Grenadines) (up to four annually), with occasional takes elsewhere (IWC 2018b).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales, along with North Atlanatic Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena</em> <em>glacialis</em>), seem to be the most vulnerable of the large whales to becoming accidentally entangled, often fatally, in fishing gear and sometimes other debris. They are also vulnerable to injury by ship strikes, which can also be fatal. In most areas, the majority of entanglements (Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2009), and also the majority of ship strikes, are likely to go undetected, but there is no generally accepted method for extrapolating from the observed events to estimate totals.<br/><br/>State members of the IWC are encouraged to report bycatches and ship strikes annually to the IWC, but few do so. The figures submitted in 2018 for entanglements include: USA 78 (26 in the Atlantic in 2015, 52 in the Pacific in 2016); Australia 46; Greenland 5, Japan 3, and New Zealand, Argentina, Norway, and Spain (1 each) (Hughes 2019). The reported ship strike numbers were: USA 13, Australia 5, and Brazil 1. &#160;The figures include some potentially non-fatal incidents (such as whales entangled and released).<br/><br/>Minimum estimates of average annual deaths in US waters are: west coast (2012-16) - 16.7 from entanglement and 2.1 from ship strikes (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2018); east coast (2010-14) ­– 7.2 from entanglements and 1.8 from ship strikes (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017); Alaska and Hawaii (2011-15) − 18 from entanglements in fishing gear, 2.8 from unspecified marine debris, and 4.4 from ship strikes (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2018). Urbán <em>et al</em>. (2017) reported 95 cases of entanglement of Humpback Whales on the Mexican Pacific coast during 2004-2017 of which 42 were released, 6 died and the fate of the others was either unknown or considered not to be severely injured.<br/><br/>In a study of Humpback entanglements in Scottish fishing gear during 1992-2016, Ryan <em>et al</em>. (2016) found that most Humpback Whales spent only brief periods in Scottish waters, but that the entanglement rate per day of whale presence was such that it would be unsustainable for a population that fed regularly in Scottish waters.<br/><br/>The distribution of Humpbacks in the Arabian Sea overlaps that of fisheries known to be dangerous to Humpbacks, and 30-40% of the photographed whales showed entanglement-related scars (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p><p></p>"

        "Addax is listed as Critically Endangered because the total population is estimated to number under 100, well below the threshold of 250 mature individuals, and all or almost all (90-100%) are in one subpopulation in the Termit Tin Toumma region of Niger. Numbers continue to decline due to poaching and disturbance from oil exploration. Latest field surveys indicate that the species has probably already reached the threshold for Critically Endangered under criterion D (&lt;50 mature individuals). <br> </br> Although long extinct in North Africa, Addax were still present in fair numbers in Mauritania, Mali, Niger and Chad up until the late 1960s and early 1970s (Newby 2013). In 2013 the total global population was estimated at probably fewer than 300 animals surviving in the wild, distributed unevenly along a narrow, 600-km-long band lying between Termit/Tin Toumma in Niger and the Djourab sand sea in Chad (Newby 2013).&#160;Termit/Tin Toumma appears to be&#160;the last&#160;viable population of Addax in the world, with ground and aerial surveys carried out in 2004&#160;indicating a population of around 200 individuals&#160;(Wacher&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004). Sightings of Addax have declined since 2007. During a field trip carried out in June 2015 by the Sahara Conservation Fund&#160;in&#160;Termit/Tin Toumma, no animals were seen during a thorough survey including all the shade trees, and only footprints of around 25 adults and three calves were found (SCF 2015a)&#160; An aerial survey in March 2016 located only three living animals; remains of Addax and Dorcas Gazelle were also found, left by poachers (Rabeil 2016). The remaining animals are assumed to have been destroyed or dispersed. It is highly probable that there are now &lt;100 Addax left in the wild, and perhaps many fewer. The species is at serious risk of becoming extinct in the wild. <br> </br> The most desert-loving large ungulate, occurring in areas of extreme temperature and aridity (less than 100 mm annually) (Newby 2013). With the exception of truly mountainous areas, Addax have been recorded from all major habitat types in the Sahara, from gravelly and sandy plains, to dune fields, sandy basins and depressions, pans and wadi systems; their preference is for harder, packed sands and flatter areas within and between dune fields that support perennial vegetation (Newby 2013, and references therein).<br/><br/>Addax are nomadic, wandering over large areas in search of grazing. In the Sahel, movements tend to be north-south in direction, for example from the more arid desert to the less arid sub-desert and Sahel (Gillet 1965, Newby 1978). In central Niger, movement may also be east-west, for example from the open desert towards the better-wooded and more varied habitats of the Aïr and Termit mountains (Hue 1960). The Addax is well known for its utilisation of extremely desolate, inhospitable, and arid habitats (Dragesco-Joffé 1993). <br> </br> The primary factor in the decline of Addax is uncontrolled hunting over many years, a process accelerating with the arrival of motor vehicles and modern weapons in the 20th century. Drought and the extension of pastoralism into desert lands, thanks to the increase in wells, have also taken a heavy toll, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s (Beudels-Jamar <em>et al</em>. 2005, Newby 2013). In recent years, the only near-viable population in Termit Tin Toumma NNR has been subject to disturbance by oil exploration and production and to shooting by their military escorts (Duncan <em>et al</em>. 2014). Finally, political instability in Libya has caused an increase in traffic in the core area of Addax distribution and a new kind of opportunistic hunting has been developed by traffickers (T. Rabeil pers. comm). <br> </br>"
        , "Preliminary genetic evidence suggests that there may be at least two species of African elephants, namely the Savanna Elephant (<span>Loxodonta africana</span>) and the Forest Elephant (<span>Loxodonta cyclotis</span>). A third species, the West African Elephant, has also been postulated. The African Elephant Specialist Group believes that more extensive research is required to support the proposed re-classification. Premature allocation into more than one species may leave hybrids in an uncertain conservation status (IUCN SSC African Elephant Specialist Group 2003). For this reason, this assessment was conducted for the single species as currently described, encompassing all populations. <br> </br>African Elephants currently occur in 37 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (see accompanying map in Supplementary Material, sourced from Blanc <span>et al</span>. 2007). They are known to have become nationally extinct in Burundi in the 1970s, in The Gambia in 1913, in Mauritania in the 1980s, and in Swaziland in 1920, where they were reintroduced in the 1980s and 1990s.<br/><br/>Although large tracts of continuous elephant range remain in parts of Central, Eastern and Southern Africa, elephant distribution is becoming increasingly fragmented across the continent. <br/><br/>The quality of knowledge available on elephant distribution varies considerably across the species' range. While distribution patterns are well understood in most of Eastern, Southern and West Africa, there is little reliable information on elephant distribution for much of Central Africa. <br> </br>Although elephant populations may at present be declining in parts of their range, major populations in Eastern and Southern Africa, accounting for over two thirds of all known elephants on the continent, have been surveyed, and are currently increasing at an average annual rate of 4.0% per annum (Blanc <span>et al</span>. 2005, 2007). As a result, more than 15,000 elephants are estimated to have been recruited into the population in 2006 and, if current rates of increase continue, the number of elephants born in these populations between 2005 and 2010 will be larger than the currently estimated total number of elephants in Central and West Africa combined. In other words, the magnitude of ongoing increases in Southern and Eastern Africa are likely to outweigh the magnitude of any likely declines in the other two regions. <br> </br>Poaching for ivory and meat has traditionally been the major cause of the species' decline. Although illegal hunting remains a significant factor in some areas, particularly in Central Africa, currently the most important perceived threat is the loss and fragmentation of habitat caused by ongoing human population expansion and rapid land conversion. A specific manifestation of this trend is the reported increase in human-elephant conflict, which further aggravates the threat to elephant populations."
        , "<p>Listed as Critically Endangered as the species numbers (at best approximately 200 mature individuals) may be undergoing a&#160;continuing decline due to climate and human/livestock impact, and no subpopulation numbers in excess of 50 mature individuals. The species may also meet the threshold for Critically Endangered under D, as there may be less than 50 mature individuals in the wild.</p> <br> </br> The African Wild Ass occurs in Eritrea and Ethiopia, and some animals may persist in Djibouti, Somalia, Sudan and Egypt, but there is no recent information available (Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013). Yalden <em>et al</em>. (1996) recorded them to 1,500 m in Ethiopia.<br/><br/>Two subspecies are recognized. The Nubian Wild Ass, <em>E. a. africanus</em>, lived in the Nubian desert of north-eastern Sudan, from east of the Nile River to the shores of the Red Sea, and south to the Atbara River and into northern Eritrea (Watson 1982). During aerial flights in the 1970s, wild asses were seen in the Barka Valley of Eritrea and in the border area between Eritrea and the Sudan (Watson 1982). The Somali Wild Ass, <em>E. a. somaliensis</em>, was found in the Denkelia region of Eritrea, the Danakil Desert and the Awash River Valley in the Afar region of north-eastern Ethiopia, western Djibouti, and into the Ogaden region of eastern Ethiopia. In Somalia, they ranged from Meit and Erigavo in the north to the Nugaal Valley, and as far south as the Shebele River (Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The current range of the African Wild Ass in Ethiopia and Eritrea is approximately 23,000 km<sup>2</sup> (Kebede 2013, Teclai 2006). DNA extracted from faecal samples collected from animals in Eritrea and Ethiopia resulted in the identification of five mitochondrial DNA haplotypes: one haplotype (group of polymorphisms) is specific to the Eritrean population (haplotype D); one haplotype specific to the Ethiopian population (haplotype E); and three shared haplotypes (A, B, and C). These results suggest that there is and/or has been gene flow between the subpopulations (Afrera, Serdo) in Ethiopia and the population in Eritrea (Oakenfull <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br> </br>The primary habitat is arid and semi-arid bushland and grassland. In Eritrea and Ethiopia, the African Wild Ass lives in volcanic landscape of the Great Rift Valley where they range from below sea level in the Dalool Depression to 2,000 m (Moehlman <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Eritrea and Ethiopia, limited observations indicate that African Wild Asses are primarily grazers, but that they will also utilize browse. Typical of arid habitat equids, the only stable groups are composed of a female and her offspring. Females do associate with other females or with males, but even temporary groups are small. Low density and low sociability may be due to low forage quality and availability. In the Mille-Serdo Wild Ass Reserve the preferred forage is <em>Aristida</em> sp., <em>Chrysopogon plumulosus</em>, <em>Dactyloctenium schindicum</em>, <em>Digitaria</em> sp., <em>Lasiurus scindicus</em>, and <em>Sporobolus iocladus</em> (Kebede 1999, Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al</em>. 2013). In Eritrea, <em>Pannicum turgidium</em> is an important forage species (Teclai 2006). <br> </br> <p>The major threat to the African Wild Ass is hunting for food and medicinal purposes; for example, body parts and soup made from bones are used for treating tuberculosis, constipation, rheumatism, backache, and bone ache (Kebede 1999, Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al. </em>2013). Limited access to drinking water and forage (largely due to competition with livestock) is also a major constraint, with reproductive females and foals less than three-months old most at risk. Hence, it will continue to be important to determine critical water supplies and basic forage requirements, allowing management authorities to determine (in consultation with local pastoralists) how to conserve the African Wild Ass (Kebede 1999, 2007; Moehlman 2002; Teclai 2006; Moehlman <em>et al.</em> 2013). The third possible threat to the survival of the African Wild Ass is potential interbreeding with the domestic donkey (Moehlman 2002, Moehlman <em>et al. </em>2013). However, there is no scientific evidence that indicates hybridization of <em>Equus africanus somaliensis </em>with domestic donkeys (Kebede 2013). &#160;</p>"
        , "<p><strong>Qualifies for listing as Critically Endangered (CR) under criteria A2abd+4abd.&#160;</strong>See Figures 8 and 9 and Tables 4 and 5 in the Supplementary Information&#160;document. While Black Rhino numbers have more than doubled since bottoming out in the mid 1990s (due to increased protection and enhanced biological management to keep more subpopulations productive), the species qualifies as CR due to the scale of the decline in numbers over the past three generations as a result of very heavy poaching in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. Three generations ago (i.e., 44 years back in 1973) the point estimate for Black Rhinos was 37,807 rhinos and despite numbers more than doubling from a low of 2,354 were only 5,495 as of end 2017. This represents a decline over three generations of 85% qualifying as CR under criterion A2. An 83% reduction was projected one year (based on data up to and including 2017) into the future (from 1974–2018). This reduction was the same as observed in point estimates for these dates. The next worse projected reduction in point estimates over three generations was when modelling two years ahead from 1975–2019 (an 81% reduction from an estimated 28,674 in 1975). Numbers continue to increase at a continental-level although at a reduced rate due to the escalation of poaching since 2007.</p> <br> </br> Black Rhino occur in a wide variety of habitats from desert areas in Namibia to wetter wooded areas. The highest densities of rhinos are found in savannas on nutrient-rich soils and in succulent Valley Bushveld areas. Black Rhino are browsers and favour small acacia's and other palatable woody species (<em>Grewia</em>'s<span>,</span> Euphorbiaceae species, etc.) as well as palatable herbs and succulents. However, because of high levels of secondary plant chemicals, much woody plant browse (especially many evergreen species) in some areas is unpalatable. Failure to appreciate this, has in the past led to carrying capacities being over-estimated in some areas. Apart from plant species composition and size structure, Black Rhino carrying capacity is related to rainfall, soil nutrient status, fire histories, levels of grass interference, extent of frost and densities of other large browsers. To maintain rapid population growth rates and prevent potential habitat damage if the population overshoots carrying capacity, populations of Black Rhinos should be managed at densities below long term ecological carrying capacity (i.e., below zero growth densities). Surplus rhino that are removed from such established populations are routinely being profitably invested in new areas with suitable habitat and protection where populations can grow rapidly. <br> </br> <p>Black Rhino face a variety of threats. The main threat to the species is illegal hunting (poaching) to supply the illegal international rhino horn trade. It is estimated that currently around 95% of rhino horn sourced in Africa for end user illegal markets in SE Asia are from this source (Emslie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). Rhino horn has traditionally had two main uses: use in Chinese medicine, and ornamental use. Recently rhino horn has become a highly prized material for making carved expensive high-status items such bowls and bangles. In the past it was also used to produce ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers (jambiyas) worn in Yemen and some Middle East countries. Historically rhino horn was also used in traditional Chinese medicine (as a fever reducer). However, most recently it appears to be shavings from carvings that are illegally sold to the medicinal market at lower prices than worked items. While Black Rhino numbers continue to increase at a continental-level poaching has slowed overall growth. Some populations have also declined. Black rhino poaching peaked in 2015 and has been declining since. See Figure 2 and Table 2 and 3 in attached Supplementary&#160;Information&#160;file.<br/><br/>The significantly increased poaching since 2007 has greatly increased protection costs and risks to investment and staff. This has resulted in reduced incentives. Some private owners in South Africa have got rid of their rhino. If this worrying trend continues this threatens to possibly reverse the expansion of range and has the potential to also reduce conservation budgets and incentives to conserve Black Rhino privately (both those privately owned and those managed for the state on a custodianship basis (due to declining live sales and greatly increased protection costs ). For more information on threats see the joint IUCN/TRAFFIC rhino report for CITES CoP18 (Emslie <em>et al</em>. 2019.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>"

        "This species qualifies as Critically Endangered because, overall, it is likely to have undergone an extremely rapid population reduction over the past three generations, such that the remaining population is likely to be tiny. However, there are some signs of recovery now.<p></p> <p></p> <br> </br> It utilises forest islands and gallery forest found fragmented throughout the Beni Savannas at an 80:20 ratio. Motacú palm <em>Attalea phalerata</em> is a principal food of all macaws in the area, with abundances ranging from 0-100% in forest islands in the savannas, and borders of gallery forest. It nests in cavities, hatching 1-3 eggs. Birds living in the north of the&#160;Llanos de Mojos breed around the end of the dry season (September and October) whilst birds in the south breed at the beginning of the wet season (November onwards) (Berkunsky <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Preferred nesting cavities typically have a diameter of 30 cm or more and are found in trees with a diameter at breast height of 60 cm or more (Gould 2013a). The species is most frequently found in pairs, but small groups (7-9) do occur and one large roosting group of 70 is known, thought to be made up of non-breeding birds (I. Berkunsky <span>in litt.</span> 2012, J. Gilardi <span>in litt.</span> 2012). <br/><p></p> <br> </br> It was severely threatened in the past by legal and illegal exploitation for the national and international cage-bird trade (A. Hesse <em>in litt</em><span >. </span>1999, I. Berkunsky <span >in litt.</span> 2012), although this has been radically reduced since 1984 (I. Berkunsky <span >in litt.</span> 2012). However in 2010 illegal trading of two recently-poached wild juvenile Blue-throated Macaws was uncovered&#160;(Berkunsky&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). The juveniles were eventually released into the wild, however this demonstrates that illegal poaching does still occur. All known breeding sites are on private cattle-ranches, where burning and clearing for pasture and tree-felling for fuel and fence posts have reduced the number of suitable nest trees and inhibited palm regeneration<strong> </strong>(Duffield and Hesse 1997, Hesse 1998, J. Gilardi <span >in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. However, cattle-rearing has occurred in the region since the 17th century (A. Hesse <em>in litt</em><span>. </span>1999); thus, the preferred food, the motacú palm <em>Attalea phalerata</em>, has been substantially reduced and is only regenerating slowly (B. Hennessey <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Nest-site competition from other macaws, toucans, bats and large woodpeckers is significant, and disturbance from mammals, birds and human activity may reduce the reproductive output of some pairs (J. Gilardi <span>in litt.</span> 2012). Between 2007 and 2012, 30 nests were monitored. Of these nests, 57% failed, with most failures occurring during incubation (Berkunsky <em>et al</em>. 2014). Reasons for nest failure were diverse but included disease, predation and abandonment. Botfly (<em>Philornis</em> spp.) infestations have been responsible for nest failures as have bees colonising nest sites, extreme weather events and parental neglect (Gould 2013a). Nestlings are vulnerable to predation from: Toco Toucan <em>Ramphastos toco</em>, Crane Hawk <em>Geranospiza caerulescens</em>, Great-horned Owl <em>Bubo virginianus&#160;</em>and Southern-crested Caracara <em>Caracara plancus</em> (Gould 2013a). Hunting to provide feathers for indigenous headdresses probably has an important impact in some areas (I. Berkunsky <span>in litt.</span> 2012). <br/><br/>There are fears that inbreeding within an increasingly fragmented population is resulting in reduced fertility<strong></strong> (Loro Parque Fundación 2003). This is compounded by a lack of recruitment to the breeding population; during a five year study, no new breeding pairs were recruited (Berkunsky&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Disease also represents a significant threat, particularly in areas where the species shares water sources with other bird species (Gould 2013a). A Population Viability Analysis found that changes in adult mortality had the greatest impact on estimates of extinction probability and population growth rates and that habitat loss and poaching also affected these estimates (Strem and Bouzat 2012).<p></p>"
        , "Recent records from Brazil indicate that this species's status may be marginally better than previously thought. Nevertheless, the remaining known population is still extremely small and fragmented, and the perturbation, damming and pollution of rivers are likely to be causing continuing declines. For these reasons, it is listed as Critically Endangered. Further information on the population size (in particular whether it exceeds 250 mature individuals) and on the subpopulation structure may result in its downlisting to Endangered in the future.<br/><p></p> <p></p> <br> </br> It inhabits shallow, fast-flowing rivers, requiring rapids and clear waters. It occurs especially in the upper tributaries of watersheds, but ranges into small rivers with patches of gallery forest surrounded by 'cerrado' (tropical savanna) or within Atlantic Forest. It is non-migratory and does not abandon the stretch of river where it establishes its territory<strong></strong> (Lamas 2006). Pairs have used 8-14 km stretches of river<strong> </strong><strong> </strong>(Bartmann 1996, L. F. Silveira<em> in litt. </em>1999)<strong></strong>, nesting in tree-cavities and rock-crevices<strong> </strong>(C. Yamashita <em>in litt.</em> 2000, Lamas and Santos 2004, Bruno <em>et al</em><span >.</span> 2010, Barbosa 2018) as well as riverbank holes (Carboneras <em>et al</em><span >. </span>2016). Breeding activity has been recorded between June and August (Lamas and Santos 2004, <strong></strong>Bruno <em>et al</em><span >. </span>2006,<span >&#160;</span>2010)<strong></strong>, but timing may vary geographically. Incubation may last c.33 days (Bruno <em>et al</em><span >.</span> 2010). Young birds have been observed between August and November<strong></strong><strong> </strong>(Lamas and Santos 2004, Bruno <em>et al</em><span >. </span>2006). The diet comprises fish, small eels, insect larvae, dobson flies (<em>Corydalis</em> spp.) and snails. In Serra da Canastra it eats mainly lambari <em>Astyanax fasciatus</em>. Territory size is believed to be related to the number of rapids, edgewaters, water speed, fish abundance and conservation of riparian vegetation<strong></strong> (Lamas 2006). Its dispersal ability is unknown, but one young male banded in September 2010 was found breeding on another river 20 km away in June 2011 (Ribeiro <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><p></p> <br> </br> Perturbation and pollution of rivers results largely from deforestation, agricultural expansion and, in the Serra da Canastra area, diamond-mining<strong> </strong>(Bartmann 1994, 1996; M. Diniz <em>in litt. </em>2013)<strong></strong>. Previously, the species was thought to rely on gallery forest which, although protected by law in Brazil, has been cleared illegally throughout much of the species's range. However, evidence suggests it will occur on unforested, undisturbed stretches of river through 'cerrado'. All recent records of the species in the Serra da Canastra region refer to unprotected sites north of the National Park. These are sites under increasing pressure from mining, development of hydropower infrastructure and agriculture (L. V. Lins <em>in litt. </em>2013). Mining has ceased in the immediate area of its known range, but there is no additional habitat for dispersing birds<strong> </strong>(L. F. Silveira<em> in litt. </em>1999), and it is thought that diamond mining will resume at Serra da Canastra in the near future (L. V. Lins <span >in litt.</span> 2012). Expanding agriculture and the construction of hydroelectric dams are considered the principal threats to the species (Braz <em>et al</em><span >.</span> 2003). Dam-building has already caused severe declines across much of its range, and is increasing in scale (L. V. Lins <span >in litt.</span> 2012). Tourist activities result in river perturbation and have been recorded within known territories and inside national parks<strong></strong> (Ibama 2006).<strong></strong><br/><p></p>"
        , "<span><em>Ateles hybridus </em>is considered Critically Endangered (CR A4cd) due to an anticipated population reduction of 80% or more over a period of 45 years (three generations), including the current generation (2018-2033) and two subsequent generations (2033-2063).<span> This reduction will likely be due, in part, to the loss of suitable habitat, calculated from Global Forest Watch data to be between 20-30% in those regions of Colombia and Venezuela in which this species occurs.<span> In addition, and perhaps more importantly, this species is very heavily hunted for its meat, as well as for the pet trade.<span> According to studies done by Peres and Palacios (2007), population densities of heavily-hunted <em>Ateles</em> species can decline by as much as 80% or more over several generations. <br/></span></span> <br> </br><p> Brown spider monkeys (<em>Ateles hybridus</em>) are found in the middle Magdalena River basin, in north-eastern Colombia, in the Perijá Mountains, in the south-eastern areas of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and across the Andes into western Venezuela. An isolated population occurs in north-eastern Venezuela in the Parque Nacional Guatopo. <br/><br/><span >In Colombia, wild populations are found on the western bank of the Magdalena River in the departments of Bolívar, Antioquia and Caldas, with most populations living in lowland forests (below 1,000 m asl.), but some recent records were reported from higher altitudes (1,780 m asl, Roncancio-Duque 2012). They are also found on the eastern bank of the Magdalena River in the departments of Magdalena and César (north of the southern slopes of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta), in the south-western parts of Guajira on the western and eastern slopes of the Serranía de Perijá, and in the middle Río Magdalena valley reaching the departments of Boyacá and Cundinamarca. West of the eastern Andes they are found in the Río Catatumbo watershed in the department of Norte de Santander and in the north-east piedmont forest of the department of Arauca (Hernández-Camacho and Cooper 1976; Defler 2003, 2004). Brown spider monkeys have a disrupted distribution in Venezuela (Mondolfi and Eisenberg 1979). They are found in the north, along the south-eastern part of the Central Mountain Range (Cordillera de la Costa) in the state of Miranda, and probably in the state of Vargas. They are also located on both sides of the Venezuelan Andean Mountains (states of Zulia, Táchira, Mérida, Trujillo, Portuguesa, Apure and Barinas). In the eastern part of its range, <span ><em>Ateles hybridus</em><span > occurs in the piedmont forest and in the highly threatened lowland forests of San Camilo and Ticoporo. In the West, it also occurs from the piedmont of the Andes throughout the lowland areas around the southern part of Lake Maracaibo to the Perijá Mountains (Sierra de Perijá) along the border with Colombia (Bodini and Pérez-Hernández 1987; Linares 1998; Cordero-Rodríguez and Biord 2001; Portillo and Velásquez 2006; Duque 2007; B. Urbani, unpubl. data).</span><br/><br/>Global Forest Watch data show that forest loss rates are between 20-30% in those regions of Colombia and Venezuela in which this species occurs (Global Forest Watch 2020).</p> <br> </br><p>Spider monkeys travel and forage in the upper levels of the forest. They spend most of their time in the canopy, sometimes use the middle and lower strata but are rarely seen in the understory. They are highly frugivorous and feed largely on ripe fleshy fruits, which comprise approximately 80% of their diet and that are mainly found in the emergent trees and upper parts of the forest canopy (Van Roosmalen and Klein 1988, Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2008, Link <em>et al.</em> 2012). They complement their diet with young leaves and flowers (especially at times of fruit shortage), with immature seeds, floral buds, aerial roots, and decaying wood (Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2008). They play a significant role as seed dispersers as they disperse large quantities of seeds from numerous canopy tree and liana species (van Roosmalen 1985, Link and Di Fiore 2006). Studies on brown spider monkeys at Las Quinchas revealed that they largely depend on ripe fruits, spending over 90% of their foraging time feeding on them (Link <em>et al.</em> 2012). Nonetheless, some populations living in fragmented areas include large quantities of young leaves in their diet (app. 40%) all year-round (Link <em>et al.</em> unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Spider monkeys live in multi-male/multi-female groups of approximately 30 individuals (range 15–60) (for review see Shimooka <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, they are rarely seen all together and are most of the time travelling, feeding and resting in small groups of varying size and composition (Symington 1990). Thus, spider monkeys have a high degree of fission fusion dynamic (Aureli <em>et al.</em> 2008). Although, spider monkeys can have home ranges as large as 400 ha (Link and Di Fiore 2013), home ranges of brown spider monkeys, in the heavily fragmented landscape at San Juan de Carare, were estimated to reach only 30-120 ha. Most probably, home ranges of groups living in continuous forests will be larger. <br/><br/> Although some populations of spider monkeys seem to have most of their births in certain months of the year (May–December for white-bellied spider monkeys at TBS, Ecuador), there is no information on birth seasonality for brown spider monkeys. Female spider monkeys disperse from their natal groups (Di Fiore <em>et al.</em> 2009) at approximately 6 years and reach sexual maturity at approximately 8–9 years of age. They give birth to single offspring after a long gestation period of 226-232 days, with average inter-birth intervals of 32-36 months.<br/><br/>Congdon (1996) provided a brief remark on the behaviour of these monkeys at the Reserva Forestal Caparo, and Duque (2007) provided a list of potential feeding trees for <em>Ateles hybridus hybridus</em> in the El Ávila National Park (however, this primate species was not observed at the time of Duque´s survey). Late maturation and long inter-birth intervals make it difficult for them to recover from hunting and other threats.<br/> <br/> Size<br/> Adult male weight: 6.5-8.5 kg (mean 7.5 kg, N=3) (Link unpubl. data)<br/> Adult female weight: not available.</p> <br> </br> In Colombia and Venezuela, <em>Ateles hybridus </em>is subject to pervasive habitat loss and to hunting (Link <em>et al.</em> 2013). In Colombia the habitat of <em>A. hybridus </em>is extremely fragmented, and currently less than 20% of the historical distribution remains (Link <em>et al.</em> 2013). There may be a few populations of adequate size to be viable in the mid- to long-term (Defler <em>et al.</em> 2003). Large and continuous forests only remain at Serranía de San Lucas, Serranía del Perijá, Catatumbo and Serranía de Las Quinchas, but a large proportion of forest fragments within their range is too small to hold viable populations. Also, in areas with large continuous forests, brown spider monkeys are heavily hunted for subsistence and for medicinal use, driving their populations to local extinction.<br/><br/>Habitat alteration appears to be the most important threat to the Venezuelan population of <em>A. hybridus</em>. The lowland forest of the state of Zulia and the piedmont of the Perijá Mountains are heavily destroyed by expanding cattle ranching activities (B. Urbani unpubl. data). Portillo and Velásquez (2006) undertook a gap analysis for this primate species within the Perijá Mountains and found that the remaining total forest area is still sufficiently large (813,257 ha), but only 30% is relatively well protected. The rest is affected by rapid human expansion and land clearance. Also, in the Perijá Mountains, these monkeys seem to be a favourite game species (Lizarralde 2002). In central Venezuela, some areas that were reported to harbour these primates (Cordero-Rodríguez and Biord 2001) were resurveyed by Duque (2007) without reporting any sightings. This is probably because most of the area is already converted into secondary vegetation. Also in this region, B. Urbani (unpubl. data) found that buffer areas around the protected areas—with confirmed populations of <em>Ateles hybridus hybridus</em> (P. N. Guatopo) and unconfirmed populations (M. N. Cueva Alfredo Jahn, P. N. Henry Pittier, P. N. San Esteban and P. N. El Ávila)—are transformed into cleared areas for slash-and-burn agriculture, human settlements or secondary forests. The lowland forests in the eastern part of the Andean Mountains (San Camilo and Ticoporo) are under severe pressure from logging."
       , "The status of Giant Otter is regularly monitored by its range countries. Of the 12 national assessments on the distribution and conservation status of the Giant Otter that were prepared, in two countries the species has been categorized in national Red Lists as Critically Endangered (Paraguay and Ecuador), in four countries as Endangered (Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia), and as Vulnerable in Brazil; it is considered Extinct in Uruguay, and probably Extinct in Argentina. In the Guianas, the Giant Otter is also protected by law though this is rarely enforced. There was a strong consensus among workers on Giant Otter that it should be considered as Endangered on a continental level. The total global Giant Otter population size is low but, more critically, individual subpopulations are fragmented and most are small. Because of its conspicuous behaviour and social nature, this species is easy to extirpate and is therefore extremely vulnerable. It remains highly susceptible to hunting (though currently hunting of Giant Otters is not a common practice). The killing of individuals and entire groups continues in some areas where fishermen are active, including in protected areas. Moreover, the Giant Otter is intrinsically vulnerable to extinction: combined with low habitat resilience and the fact that only a quarter to a third of the total population reproduces, the species also shows late maturity, late breeding age, suspected low transient survival, and low cub survival - all are traits which limit Giant Otter recovery and re-colonization. Although widely distributed on a continental scale, overall they may occupy less than 5%, often less than 1% of a given watershed. This means that changes in this specific habitat, or impacts there-in, will have severe effects even if only a fraction of the overall area is affected. Rivers are roads into the forest, this is where people settle, where gold mining takes place, where there is competition for fish or overfishing, where green energy can be harvested, where climate change will have strong impacts, where contamination can be spread rapidly, and so on. This vital link to rivers and wetlands renders the Giant Otter much more susceptible than most other comparable large predators of the Amazon, such as the Jaguar.<br/><br/>Many emerging and/or growing threats pose serious problems for Giant Otters including contamination, overfishing and conflict with fishermen, and infrastructure such as roads and hydroelectric dams. With their preference for lowland wetlands, rivers, and lakes, their prime habitat overlaps completely with the demands of humans (gold mining, fishing, deforestation, mega infrastructure and energy developments, settlement, transport, tourism, etc.). The effects of climate change are already being felt, with Brazil recently suffering severe droughts. Large-scale deforestation in the Amazon could reduce basin-wide rainfall by 12% during the wet season and by 21% in the dry season by 2050 (Spracklen <em>et al</em>. 2012) with unknown impacts on (semi) aquatic species.<br/><br/>In summary, three Giant Otter generation lengths approximately represent a 25 year period. Accelerating habitat destruction and degradation throughout the Giant Otter's range represents the greatest threat to the species, and is estimated to potentially lead to a future reduction in population size of 50% or more over the next 25 years, through a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence, and quality of habitat (subcriterion c), with pollutants (especially mercury and fossil fuels), pathogens (domestic animal diseases), and competitors (fishermen) (subcriterion e) potentially playing important roles. The species is confirmed to be Endangered. <br> </br> The Giant Otter is known to inhabit large, slow-moving rivers, streams, lakes and swamps (Duplaix 1980, Carter and Rosas 1997). In a long-term study in Peru, Giant Otters were found in most of the river systems in the southeastern part of the country with the exception of those located close to the Andes where the flow gradient is steeper (Schenck 1999). Studies in Suriname have shown a preference for black water creeks and rivers with sandy or rocky bottoms (Duplaix 1980). Large rivers of lowland areas with gentle flow and oxbow lakes with high fish densities represent the environment most favoured by this species (Schenck 1999), and areas with gently-sloped riverbanks and dense, overhanging vegetation are preferred habitat features (Duplaix 1980). On occasion, Giant Otters are seen in agricultural canals, reservoirs of dams and drainage channels along roads (Ribas <em>et al</em>. 2012). Giant Otters tend to concentrate in their preferred habitats and maintain territories that can be very small and stable year-round in lakes (105 ha for a group of 5-14 otters; Groenendijk and Hajek 2006), or may show considerable variation and be larger in river systems. Habitat requirements include: undisturbed, high banks for denning, sites for latrines, and abundant prey populations.<br/><br/>A typical Giant Otter subpopulation consists of family groups of 2-15 with well established territories, plus sexually mature transients. Family groups are composed of a dominant breeding pair, non-breeding subadults and offspring. Sometimes non-related subadults may be accepted by a group (Ribas 2011, Duplaix 2004) As a rule, each group produces a litter once a year, although two litters have been occasionally recorded. Gestation is around 64-77 days and litters range from 1-6 young (averaging 2) though it is rare to see litters greater than four in the wild (Duplaix 1980, Staib 2005, Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). Reproductive success is related to group size and habitat quality with smaller groups having lower success (Schenck 1999, Groenendijk and Hajek 2006).<br/><br/>The Giant Otter diet consists almost exclusively of fish, up to four kilograms per day, although caiman and turtles may also occasionally be consumed (Staib 2005, Ribas <em>et al</em>. 2012, Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). The feeding ecology of <em>P. brasiliensis</em> has been shown to be highly dependent upon the seasonal migrations of fish populations (Duplaix 1980).<br/><br/>Giant Otters attain sexual maturity at roughly 2.5 years of age (Sykes-Gatz 2005, Oliveria <em>et al</em>. 2011), but first breeding occurs on average two years later (Groenendijk <em>et al</em>. unpublished). This, in tandem with high cub mortality (Groenendijk <em>et al</em>. unpublished), suspected high transient mortality, and difficulty to establish new groups (Schenck <em>et al</em>. 2003), means that population recovery and colonization of new areas can be slow. <br> </br> While in the past, hunting for pelts greatly impacted the Giant Otter population, currently the species is threatened by multiple anthropogenic influences arising from increased human settlement and activity throughout the species range. These result in modification and destruction of riparian habitat, overfishing, contamination of aquatic ecosystems (especially due to gold mining, fossil fuel exploration, and the use of pesticides and fertilizers for monocultures), domestic animal diseases, and mismanaged tourism (Duplaix 1980, Groenendijk 1998, Schenck 1999, Utreras 2001, Utreras and Tirira 2011).<br/><br/>Gold mining, artisanal as well as industrial, is a significant threat to the species, particularly in the Guiana Shield region (Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, Venezuela and northern Brazil) and in southeastern Peru. Its main impacts are habitat destruction, sedimentation of rivers, and pollution (Mongabay.com). Gold miners cut swathes into the floodplain forest and blast river banks with pressure hoses, using mercury to amalgamate gold particles. Gold prices are at a record high - now approaching US$1,800/oz. - and mercury is cheap. Peruvian mercury imports have risen 42% (2006-2009) to 130 t/yr, almost all of which is used directly in artisanal gold mining. Forest conversion to mining increased six-fold from 2003-2006 (292 ha/yr) to 2006-2009 (1,915 ha/yr) (Swenson <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Areas impacted by gold-mining have been shown to still have depleted fish populations and to not have been re-colonized by otters over a decade after mining stopped. In areas of gold mining, fish are contaminated with mercury. Gutleb <em>et al</em>. (1997) found that mercury concentrations in the majority of fish in the area of Manu National Park were higher than what is considered tolerable in the Eurasian Otter. However, the expected high concentrations of methylmercury in Giant Otter tissues have not been corroborated due to the difficulty of finding dead Giant Otters. Migration of contaminated fish and long-range atmospheric transport of mercury probably increase the miner’s area of influence.<br/><br/>One of the major future threats are the many planned hydroelectric dams within the region; these will change habitats and alter hydrological regimes of rivers downstream with resulting impacts on fish populations and habitat. There are plans for 151 new dams greater than two MW over the next 20 years (the time-span considered for this assessment is 24 years), more than a 300% increase. These dams would include five of the six major Andean tributaries of the Amazon. Ecological impact analysis classified 47% of the potential new dams as high impact and just 19% as low impact. Sixty per cent of the dams would cause the first major break in connectivity between protected Andean headwaters and the lowland Amazon. More than 80% would drive deforestation due to new roads, transmission lines, or inundation (Finer and Jenkins 2012). Giant Otters are able to live in some artificial lakes such as the shallow Balbina Lake (Rosas <em>et al</em>. 2007 but the population level impact of these projects is unknown. Other major infrastructure projects include the Inter-oceanic highway in southeastern Peru, and the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America (IIRSA) (V. Utreras pers. comm. 2012).<br/><br/>Molecular research suggests that the Giant Otter populations of the Madre de Dios drainage have a distinct evolutionary history and consequently represents an evolutionary unit, an important segment of the species’ total genetic diversity (Pickles <em>et al</em>. 2011). The current and projected high level of threat facing this population together with its intrinsic importance in safeguarding the evolutionary potential of the species make it of high conservation concern.Giant Otters are vulnerable to disturbance from poorly managed tourism, including sport fishing. With increasing tourism in South America it has proved important to control tourism on lakes and rivers both in and outside protected areas (Schenck and Staib 2000, Groenendijk and Hajek 2006). Monitoring of Giant Otter and tourist groups before and after implementation of management zoning has shown that Giant Otter reproductive success and sighting success by tourists on unmanaged lakes is considerably lower than on managed lakes (Groenendijk and Hajek 2006).<br/><br/>Giant Otter cubs held in captivity have died of canine parvovirus and all mustelids are susceptible to canine distemper, so domestic animal diseases could pose a serious threat to wild giant otter populations. Infection could also occur in remote areas since transient otters and people hunting with dogs travel large distances with potential for contact and infection of immunologically naive populations (Schenck <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/>Human/Giant Otter conflict is emerging as an increasingly important problem. Otters may be killed for fun or out of fear, or, more often, because they are seen as competitors for fish by loggers, miners, and fishermen who often blame them for depleting fish resources used for local consumption and in commercial and sport fishing (Gómez and Jorgensen 1999, Recharte <em>et al</em>. 2008, Rosas-Ribeiro <em>et al</em>. 2011, Utreras and Tirira 2011). Additionally, Giant Otters are sometimes blamed for damage to fishing nets and traps (Rosas-Ribeiro <em>et al</em>. 2011). Fish-farming is rapidly increasing within the species’ range and may prove to be a source of conflict and habitat degradation in the future. Giant Otters occasionally become trapped in fishing nets and drown. Cubs are sometimes captured illegally to keep as pets.<br/><br/>Giant Otters are highly susceptible to persecution: they are large, easily visible, very social, and vocal. They are diurnal and occupy open habitats and stable territories. Their sign – latrines and dens - is easily recognizable and often visible, making it possible to identify areas of recent activity by a group (Groenendijk <em>et al</em>. 2005). Individuals and groups often react to people by approaching to investigate. Moreover, only the dominant pair produces young, and usually only once a year. During the years of the pelt trade, these life history attributes of the species combined to make it extremely vulnerable, and today may cause it to be an easy target for fishermen as was documented recently on two different rivers in southeastern Peru (R. Williams pers. comm. 2012), and in the Sustainable Development Reserve Uacari, in Brazil (Rosas-Ribeiro <em>et al</em>. 2011) where 21 Giant Otters were killed over an undefined period between 2006 and 2006 (M. Marmontel and Lima pers. comms.). In 2011-2012, the Kanamari indigenous people promoted a massive Giant Otter killing in their territory (Território Indigena Kanamari, adjacent to the SDR Uacari), based on their perception that the species is overfishing the river turtle population. The community leader bought 300 cartridges and distributed these amongst other hunters; 64 Giant Otters were shot (Endo pers. comm. 2012). Such incidents of targeted killing can contribute significantly to the extinction of small subpopulations in a watershed.<br/><br/>It seems likely that mining activities and the widespread conversion of forest into agricultural and pasture lands will continue unabated in the near future as part of the economic development of the Amazonian countries. Brazil, which represents roughly three quarters of the Giant Otter’s current distribution range, merits greater consideration. As stated earlier, Giant Otter populations of the Pantanal appear to be recovering, with signs of reaching carrying capacity in some areas (Ribas <em>et al</em>. 2012). Populations are stable and possibly recovering in some parts of the Amazon (Rosas <em>et al</em>. 2008). However, the human population is increasing and expanding simultaneously and the Amazon region registered the highest population growth of the whole country in the last census (IBGE 2010). As a consequence, we can expect colonization of new regions, intensive exploitation of natural resources, destruction of forests, reduction of water quality, and overfishing. Furthermore, the proposed mega-projects included in the Growth Acceleration Plan (PAC) as well as the recently approved federal law, represent a significant threat to Amazonian diversity."

         "This species is listed as Critically Endangered because its extent of occurrence is less than 100 sq km, area of occupancy is less than 10 sq km, number of locations is one, adult population size probably does not exceed 250 and could be much smaller, water quality is subject to ongoing degradation, and habitat is vulnerable to loss of a critical source of organic material (bats). <br/> This species range includes only Key Cave, Lauderdale County, Alabama (Page and Burr 2011); the cave opens on the north bank of the Tennessee River west of Florence, near the southeastern edge of the Highland Rim. A survey of 120 other caves in the region, conducted since 1977, failed to locate any other populations. <br> </br> This species is known only from one site (USFWS 1990).<br/><br/>Total adult population size is uncertain but very small. As of 1983, only nine specimens (in collections) were known. In the 1980s, the population was estimated as fewer than 100 individuals, and no more than 10 cavefish had ever been observed on a single visit (USFWS 1985). In 36 recorded excursions into Key Cave by biologists from 1967 to 1998, a total of only 130 Alabama cavefish were observed (Boschung and Mayden 2004).<br/><br/>USFWS (1990, recovery plan) stated that the trend was not known. Survey results of Kuhajda and Mayden (2001) indicated that the population may be relatively stable. <br> </br> Habitat includes clear lentic subterranean waters, in the Warsaw limestone formation; cave supports diverse aquatic fauna (crayfish, isopods, amphipods), a rich terrestrial fauna (especially guanobies), and a summer colony of bats (<em>Myotis grisescens</em>) (Cooper and Kuehne 1974). <br> </br> Factors most likely to limit or cause the decline of the Alabama cavefish include unsuccessful reproduction, groundwater degradation, alteration in drainage and hydrologic patterns, lower ground water levels, collecting, and diminished organic matter inputs (USFWS 1990).<br/><br/>Groundwater degradation from urbanization and possible industrialization in the recharge area is an ongoing threat (Kuhajda and Mayden 2001, Boschung and Mayden 2004).<br/><br/>One of the primary threats is interference with the associated bat populations which indirectly contribute to the fish's food chain. Another serious threat is groundwater contamination from agricultural operations and a sewage disposal project for the City of Florence, Alabama. Most of Key Cave's recharge area is in row crops, and a sludge disposal project is also within the recharge area. Natural factors contributing to the vulnerability of this species are its small population size and low reproductive potential. Competition with the more numerous and aggressive southern cavefish for food and space is also a problem. Cave crayfish, a known predator of this species, are also abundant in Key Cave. Source: USFWS (http://www.fws.gov/ecos/ajax/docs/life_histories/E011.html).<br/><br/>Loss or reduction of the bat population as a result of white-nose syndrome could have major negative effects of the cavefish population."   
        , "After the removal of all surviving birds into captivity in 1987, an intensive conservation programme involving reintroduction and release of captive-bred birds has led to a very small but increasing population of this species in the wild. However, the population in the wild remains dependent on intensive conservation management efforts. The species consequently qualifies as Critically Endangered. <p></p> <p></p> <br> </br> This species declined rapidly throughout its historic range from British Columbia to Baja California during the 19th century and reportedly disappeared from outside California, <strong>U.S.A.</strong>, in 1937 (Wilbur and Kiff 1980, L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. The population had dropped to an all-time low of just 22 birds by 1981, and in 1983 eggs were first taken from wild nests for captive-rearing; in 1987 the species became extinct in the wild when the last of the six wild individuals was captured to join a captive-breeding recovery programme involving 27 birds (Wilbur and Kiff 1980,<em></em> Toops 2009)<strong></strong>. Due to intensive captive breeding efforts the population increased to 223 birds by August 2003, comprising 138 in captivity, and 85 reintroduced in California and northern Arizona (L. Kiff <em>in</em> <em>litt. </em>2003)<strong></strong>. Breeding in the wild resumed in 2002, and by February 2009 56 nesting attempts had been recorded, from which at least 19 chicks have fledged and survived (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. In December 2003, birds were released at the Pinnacles National Monument in California, where one pair were observed raising chicks in 2009 (Moir 2009)<strong></strong>. Releases in New Mexico have been abandoned due to lack of funding, and release priorities have shifted to identifying sites and partnerships in southern Sierra Nevada, California (Chu <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. The regular movements of the Arizona birds are confined to Coconnino County (Arizona) and Kane County (Utah), although one individual wandered north to Flaming Gorge (Wyoming) and localities in Colorado before returning to the Grand Canyon area. The California birds occur regularly in San Bernardino, Los Angeles, Ventura, Kern, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterrey, San Benito, and probably Santa Cruz counties. By December 2006, there were 130 wild birds at five release sites (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2006, <strong></strong>Graham 2006)<strong></strong>, including at least 44 that were over six years old, the earliest age at which the species breeds (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>, and in February 2012, the total population stood at 173 individuals in captivity and 213 in the wild, primarily in southern and central California (Carpentier 2009, C. N. Parish <span >in litt.</span> 2012)<strong></strong>. In January 2010, the number of released birds that had produced viable offspring stood at 44, with another 60 birds of breeding age (J. Grantham <em>in litt.</em> 2010)<strong></strong>. By 2017, the total population has increased to 446 birds (Vulture Specialist Group 2017). The Arizona/Utah population now numbers 78 birds, with four birds released in 2017 and another 10 earmarked for release in 2018 (Vulture Specialist Group 2017). <br/><br/>The reintroduction programme continues and has expanded its geographic coverage, with six birds released into the Sierra de San Pedro Martir in Baja California, <strong>Mexico</strong> in 2002 (USFWS 2002)<strong></strong>. A release site in Baja was established in October 2003. The first chick born in Mexico for over 75 years hatched in April 2007. The Baja California birds are largely confined to the Sierra de San Pedro Martir (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2006)<strong></strong>, where efforts are ongoing to increase the population to an anticipated carrying capacity of c.20 pairs (Wallace 2005)<strong></strong>. It is hoped these birds will range widely enough to be effectively connected with birds in the southern U.S.A., and a bird from the Baja population was seen in San Diego County in April 2007. 2015 was an important year for the species in terms of its recovery in the wild as it was the first year when the number of individuals that died in the wild was less than the number of juveniles that fledged (Silber 2016). Second generation birds have recently matured to breeding age, but no population can be deemed sustainable, and without substantial reductions in the use of lead-based ammunition within the condor's range none are likely to become so (Finkelstein <em>et al.</em> 2012)<strong></strong>. The recovery programme for the species continues to address threats to the wild population, but lead contamination remains the greatest of these threats (C. Battistone <em>in litt. </em>2016).&#160;<p></p> <br> </br> Its range includes rocky, open-country scrubland, coniferous forest and oak savanna<strong></strong>. Cliffs, rocky outcrops or large trees are used as nest sites (USFWS 1996)<strong></strong>. It scavenges on the carcasses of large mammals and also feeds on the carcasses of small mammals, but perhaps only where there are sufficient numbers at one site (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. Released birds have become increasingly independent in finding food and may range more than 400 km from release sites (Anon. 1998), though the distance an individual ranges can vary depending on season and individuals released at different sites have shown significantly different home range sizes (Rivers <em>et al. </em>2014), suggesting local ecological factors may play a role.<p></p> <br> </br> The drastic population decline during the 20th century is principally attributed to persecution and accidental ingestion of fragments from lead bullets and lead shot from carcasses (C. N. Parish <span >in litt.</span> 2012), resulting in lead poisoning. Lead poisoning remains a key threat for released birds (Kelly <em>et al</em>. 2014) and has caused many fatalities and resulted in the treatment of many more birds (Anon. 2001, Parish <em>et al</em><span >.</span> 2007, Walters <em >et al</em><span >.</span> 2010)<strong></strong>; 9 of 13 birds released at the Pinnacles National Monument in California had to be recaptured and tested for lead poisoning after feasting on a field of squirrel carcasses shot by hunters using lead-shot in 2006. It is particularly prone to the threat of lead-poisoning owing to its longevity and delayed-onset breeding strategy, and given the distances it travels to forage, meaning lead can build up in the blood to dangerous levels over many years having been ingested over a broad area (Hunt <em>et al</em><span >. </span>2007)<strong></strong>. Shooting and accidental poisoning continue to be the principal threats to condors and at current levels threaten the long-term sustainability of reintroduced populations (Cade 2007)<strong></strong>, but lead ammunition is being banned within the species's range in California and there are increasing indications that the federal government will gradually phase out the use of lead across the U.S. Despite efforts to reduce the threat of lead-poisoning, it is reported that over 90% of condors released in Arizona still test positive for lead (Toops 2009)<strong></strong> and in January 2010 three birds were found to have died from lead-poisoning in northern Arizona. A study conducted in California, using samples collected in 2004-2009, suggests that around one third of condors in the region are experiencing toxicological effects from lead ammunition (Finkelstein <em>et al.</em> 2012)<strong></strong>. A study using samples collected between 1997 and 2011 showed that blood lead concentrations increased as birds became less reliant on provisioned food, as they became older and as their home range size increased (Kelly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). In 2017, 69 of the 78 birds in the Arizona/Utah population showed high levels of lead exposure; despite a treatment, two individuals died from severe lead-poisoning (Vulture Specialist Group 2017). In preparation of a potential release at new sites in northern California, a study found that Common Ravens <em>Corvus corax</em>&#160;and Turkey Vultures <em>Cathartes aura</em>&#160;in the region still suffered from high lead contamination (West <em>et al.</em> 2017). Publicity and awareness raising campaigns appear to have successfully reduced persecution.&#160;<br/>The population along the Central Pacific Californian coast also suffers from reduced eggshell thickness, consistent with the effects of the breakdown compounds of the pesticide DDT, compromising reproduction in the wild (Burnett <em>et al.</em> 2013). Apparently restricted to this population, it is thought that this is linked to feeding on the carcasses of predatory marine mammals that had been exposed to the pesticide from a specific point source during their lifetimes (Burnett<em> et al. </em>2013, Kurle <em>et al. </em>2016). The lack of additional DDT inputs suggests that these effects will decrease over time, though at present this is a further significant impediment to sustainable wild reproduction in this population. Ingested anthropogenic material was recently responsible for the deaths of two nestlings and strongly implicated in a number of other deaths<strong></strong>. The dead condors were found to have swallowed glass fragments, wire, plastic cartridge cases, etc. (Mee <em >et al</em><span >.</span> 2007)<strong></strong>. Two birds were shot in California in 2009. Both were alive as of April 2009, both being treated for lead poisoning (Anon. 2009)<strong></strong>. Puppet-reared birds may be more prone to exhibit problematic human-oriented behaviour such as tameness and vandalising property than parent-reared birds (Meretsky <em>et al. </em>2000)<strong></strong>. However, there is no apparent difference in mortality between released birds that were puppet-reared and those which were parent-reared (Woods <em>et al.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. In the early 1990s a number of captive-reared birds were lost owing to collisions with power-lines, but this behavioural problem has been addressed using a conditioning programme with fake power poles (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>. The spread of west Nile virus is not anticipated to be a problem for the species as most birds are vaccinated (L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2005)<strong></strong>. Overall survival of released birds has been high, although without the capture, treatment and re-release of lead contaminated birds it is likely that rates of mortality in the wild still exceed sustainable levels (Walters <em>et al</em><span >.</span> 2010, L. Kiff <em>in litt. </em>2009)<strong></strong>. <p></p>"
        , "The Red Wolf was Extinct in the Wild by 1980, but was reintroduced by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1987 into eastern North Carolina. By the early 2000s the total population within the reintroduction area included more than 150 animals. By 2016, the USFWS began restricting the reintroduction effort to federal public land in mainland Dare County, North Carolina (i.e., the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge and Dare County Bombing Range). This ~ 800 km² area can support no more than 20 to 30 wolves. If such a restriction is finalized wolves living outside this area probably will be afforded little or no federal protection or be captured and returned to captivity to bolster the vigour of the captive breeding programme.&#160; Hybridization with Coyotes or Red Wolf x Coyote hybrids and landowner intolerance (and subsequent human-caused mortality) are the primary threats to the species' persistence in the wild. <br> </br> Very little is known about Red Wolf habitat because the species' range was severely reduced by the time scientific investigations began. Given their wide historical distribution, Red Wolves probably utilized a large suite of habitat types at one time. The last naturally occurring population utilized the coastal prairie marshes of south-west Louisiana and south-east Texas (Carley 1975; Shaw 1975). However, many agree that this environment probably does not typify preferred Red Wolf habitat. There is evidence that the species was found in highest numbers in the once extensive bottomland river forests and swamps of the south-east (Paradiso and Nowak 1971, 1972; Riley and McBride 1972). Red Wolves reintroduced into north-eastern North Carolina and their descendants have made extensive use of habitat types ranging from agricultural lands to pocosins. Pocosins are forest/wetland mosaics characterized by an overstory of loblolly and pond pine (<em>Pinus taeda</em> and <em>Pinus serotina</em>, respectively) and an understory of evergreen shrubs (Christensen <em>et al.</em> 1981). This suggests that Red Wolves are habitat generalists and can thrive in most settings where prey populations are adequate and persecution by humans is slight. The findings of Hahn (2002) seem to support this generalization in that low human density, wetland soil type, and distance from roads were the most important predictor of potential wolf habitat in eastern North Carolina. <br> </br> Hybridization with Coyotes or Red Wolf x Coyote hybrids is the primary threat to the species' persistence in the wild (Kelly <em>et al</em>. 1999). While hybridization with Coyotes was a factor in the Red Wolf's initial demise in the wild, it was not detected as a problem in north-eastern North Carolina until approximately 1992 (Phillips <em>et al</em>. 1995). Indeed, north-eastern North Carolina was determined to be ideal for Red Wolf reintroductions because of a purported absence of Coyotes (Parker 1986). However, during the 1990s, the Coyote population apparently became well established in the area (P. Sumner pers. comm.; USFWS, unpubl.). From the start of the reintroduction project in 1987 through to about 2005, the Red Wolf population grew to more than 150 animals. Intensive management was useful at minimizing the extent of hybridization with Coyotes and Coyote/Red Wolf hybrids (Gese and Terletzky 2015, Gese <em>et al</em>. 2015). However, by about 2012, the reintroduction project had become notably characterized by significant conflict with landowners (primarily over Coyote management and general frustration with the USFWS’s implementation of the Red Wolf recovery programme) which led to a substantial increase in the illegal killing of Red Wolves."
        , "This species is listed as Critically Endangered because apparent population size has declined by more than 90 percent over the past 10 years (three generations is around 3 years), and the decline is ongoing. Extent of occurrence is less than 1,000 sq km, area of occupancy is probably less than 500 sq km, and number of locations is one. Population size is unknown. Quantitative analysis calculated a 50 percent likelihood that the species could reach effective extinction within 20 years. Should the recent steep decline abate, the species would still easily qualify for Endangered status.<br> </br> This euryhaline species inhabits open waters of bays, tidal rivers, channels, and sloughs; it rarely occurs in water with salinity of more than 10-12 ppt; when not spawning, it tends to concentrate where salt water and freshwater mix (salinity about 2 ppt) and zooplankton populations are dense (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1989; USFWS 1993, 1996). Populations are concentrated mainly in the lower Delta and upper Suisun Bay after breeding (at least formerly). Adequate freshwater flows are needed to transport young to rearing habitat and to maintain rearing habitat in a favourable location (i.e., Suisun Bay). <br/><br/>Spawning occurs in freshwater (sometimes in slightly brackish water), primarily in tidal dead-end sloughs and channel edgewaters. Eggs are demersal and adhesive. Larvae are buoyant and are carried downstream until they reach the mixing zone; area of the 2 ppt isohaline is an important rearing habitat for the young. See USFWS (1996) and Moyle (2002). <br> </br> The decline may be attributable to the Delta Smelt's low fecundity and one-year lifespan, in combination with changes and fluctuations in the estuarine ecosystem. These changes and fluctuations include: reduction in outflows (water projects have allowed the intrusion of higher salinity water into the Delta, restricting the smelt's spawning and nursery areas to less favourable river channel habitat and making them more vulnerable to diversion in massive water project pumping plants); entrainment losses of larvae and adults to water diversion (attempts to rescue entrained smelt are probably largely unsuccessful, as these fishes are relatively fragile and often die when trapped and transported); high outflows during years with unusually high rainfall (flush smelt and their food resources out of the system; may make it easier for exotic species of copepods, clams and fishes to colonize); and changes in food resources (e.g., increased abundance of various species of exotic copepods, which could deplete smelt food resources and/or be more difficult for smelt to capture; the introduced clam, <em>Potamocorbula</em>, now abundant in Suisun Bay, may reduce availability of zooplankton to smelt larvae; the diatom <em>Melosira</em>, which is difficult for zooplankton to consume, sometimes becomes very abundant in the Delta) (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1989; Moyle 2002; USFWS 1993, 1996).<br/><br/>Hybridization (e.g., introduced <em>Hypomesus nipponensis</em> represents a potential threat through hybridization and/or competition; hybrids may be sterile but interbreeding may result in loss of Delta Smelt gametes).<br/><br/>Water pollution (toxic substances from agriculture and urbanization) poses a threat of unknown degree (California Department of Fish and Game 1990, Moyle 2002).<br/><br/>USFWS (Federal Register, 6 January 1994) listed the following activities as potential threats to critical habitat: sand and gravel excavation in river channels or marshes; diking wetlands for conversion to farmland and dredging to maintain these dikes; levee maintenance and bank-protection activities, such as riprapping, removal of vegetation, and placement of dredged materials on levees or banks; operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure; and bridge and marina construction.<br/><br/>In reviewing the status of the Delta Smelt, USFWS (2004) made the following conclusions. Threats posed by extreme outflow conditions, the operations of the state and federal water projects, and other water diversions as described in the original listing (USFWS 1993) remain. Although some conservation measures have helped to ameliorate threats from adverse hydrological conditions and water diversions, it is unclear how effective these will continue to be over time based on available funding and future demands for water. Increases in water demands are likely to result in less suitable rearing conditions for Delta Smelt in Suisun Marsh, increased vulnerability to entrainment, and less water available for maintaining favourable habitat conditions. The importance of exposure to toxic chemicals on the population of Delta Smelt is highly uncertain. Threats posed by disease and predation have not been sufficiently studied, and their effects on Delta Smelt remain poorly known. Hybridization with <em>Hypomesus nipponensis</em> appears not to be a major threat. Existing regulatory mechanisms, particularly relating to water management and its affect on smelt habitat, are inadequate to assure the long-term existence of Delta Smelt in Suisun Bay and the Delta (USFWS 2004). The only new information concerning the Delta Smelt's population size and extinction probability indicates that the population is at risk of falling below an effective population size and therefore in danger of becoming extinct.<br/><br/>An updated status review (USFWS 2010) yielded the following conclusions: Destruction, modification, or curtailment of habitat poses a current and future threat. Operation of upstream reservoirs, increased water exports, and upstream diversions have altered the location and extent of the low-salinity zone, concentrating smelt in an area with competing fish species. Upstream reservoirs and the increased presence of the exotic submerged aquatic plant <em>Egeria densa</em> have also reduced turbidity levels in rearing habitat, which may reduce foraging efficiency. Predation is probably a low-level threat at this time. The continued decline in apparent abundance suggests that existing regulatory mechanisms, as currently implemented, are not adequate to reduce the threats to the species. Other threats includes entrainment by water export facilities and into power plant diversions, contaminants, and small population effects."

        "<p>Its extremely restricted distribution, very small numbers of adults in the wild, and drastic decline over the past three generations all justify an assessment of Critically Endangered for <em>Alligator sinensis</em>. Ongoing efforts to protect the few wild individuals and habitat localities, reintroduction and a large captive breeding stock may be insufficient to ensure survival of this species.</p>  <br> </br> The Chinese Alligator is a relatively small crocodilian with a maximum length of approximately 2 m (Brazaitis 1973). The three principal habitat types where <em>A. sinensis</em> can now be found are:<br/><ul><li>remnant wetlands in low, broad, fertile valleys along main river courses, dominated by paddy fields;</li><li>intermediate ponds in low hill valleys (&lt;100 m) but with significant agriculture in the valley above the pond; and,</li><li>ponds situated in low hill valleys (&lt;100 m) at the upper edge of rice cultivation and the low edge of tree plantations (Ding <em>et al</em>. 2001, Thorbjarnarson <em>et al</em>. 2002, Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 1982).</li></ul>Because they occur at relatively high northern latitude, Chinese Alligators spend a large portion of the year hibernating (aestivating) in subterranean burrows (Huang 1982, Huang and Watanabe 1986). The burrows can be complex, with above and below ground pools, and numerous air holes (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1985). The extensive use of these burrows and their very secretive behaviour has allowed <em>A. sinensis </em>to inhabit wetland habitats in areas with dense human populations.<br/><br/>Chinese Alligators usually begin to emerge from their dens to bask in May. In June, with warming temperatures, they will begin to make nocturnal sorties. Nesting occurs from early July to late August (Huang 1982), with 10-40 eggs being laid in a mound nest of decaying vegetation (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1985). <br> </br> The factors most responsible for the population decline have varied over the last 50 years, but have included habitat fragmentation and degradation, hunting, natural disasters (floods and drought), geographic separation, low productivity and pollution. From the 1950s to 1990s, habitat loss and the killing of alligators were the most significant factors.<br/><br/>Presently, killing of alligators is less of an issue but the loss of habitat has been virtually complete. Therefore, the highest priority for the conservation of <em>A. sinensis </em>is habitat restoration as the first step towards reintroduction of captive-bred individuals. In addition, the potential consequences of environmental pollution and reduced genetic diversity of the wild population must be addressed (Ding <em>et al</em>. 2004)."
        , "Historically, the Sumatran and Bornean Orangutans were both considered to be subspecies of&#160;<em>Pongo pygmaeus</em>&#160;(e.g., Rijksen and Meijaard 1999). Recent taxonomic reviews (Groves 2001, Brandon-Jones&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004) support the acceptance of the Sumatran Orangutan (<em>Pongo abelii</em>) as distinct from its Bornean relative (<em>Pongo pygmaeus</em>). This classification has since been widely adopted (e.g., Singleton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004).&#160;A recent study (Nater&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017) proposed that the Batang Toru population is a separate species (<em>Pongo tapanuliensis</em>), and therefore this assessment does not include the orangutans in that area. <br> </br> Due to high levels of habitat conversion and fragmentation, and illegal killing, <em>Pongo abelii</em> is estimated to have experienced a significant population reduction in recent years. Forest loss data indicate that key Sumatran Orangutan forest habitat (i.e., below 500 m asl) was reduced by 60% of its area between 1985 and 2007 (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2011). It is thought that this reduction will continue as forests within the species’ range remain under considerable threat (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2016). When relative stability returned to Aceh in 2005 after several years of civil conflict, pressure on natural habitats increased dramatically (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2011). Significant areas of the Orangutan’s range are seriously threatened by logging, mining concessions and agricultural plantations, while new roads are continuously being cut through the habitat. Even in formally protected areas, Orangutans remain under threat from forest conversion to plantations, illegal settlement and encroachment (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2011, 2016). Furthermore, an illegal spatial land-use plan being implemented by the Government of Aceh Province ignores the Leuser Ecosystem’s status as a 'National Strategic Area', designated for its environmental function.&#160;Moreover, modelling based on different land-use scenarios and their likely impacts predicts that approximately an additional 4,000 Sumatran Orangutans could be lost by 2030 as a direct consequence of this spatial plan and related developments, and that in 2060 there could be a 81% decline of the population compared to the population in 1985 (Wich <em>et al.</em> 2016, Nowak unpublished data).&#160; &#160;<br/><br/>Due to their slow life history, with a generation time of at least 25 years (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2009), Sumatran Orangutan populations are unable to sustain substantial and continual loss of individuals. If the rate of decline observed since 1985 and predicted continues unabated, the population decline will exceed 80% over a three-generation period (i.e., 75 years from 1985 to 2060), hence qualifying <em>Pongo abelii</em> as Critically Endangered under criterion A4. <br> </br> Sumatran Orangutans inhabit moist lowland forest, montane forest and peat swamps. They are diurnal and almost exclusively arboreal; females virtually never travel on the ground and adult males do so only rarely. This contrasts somewhat with Bornean Orangutans (especially adult males), which descend and travel on the ground more often (Ancrenaz <em>et al</em>. 2014). While both species depend on high-quality primary forests, Bornean Orangutans appear better able to tolerate limited habitat disturbance (Husson <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Sumatra, densities plummet by up to 60%, even if logging is highly selective (see Rao and van Schaik 1997) and Orangutan behavioural ecology differs in primary and logged forests (Hardus <em>et al</em>. 2012a).<br/><br/>Sumatran Orangutans are primarily frugivores, but also eat young and mature leaves, seeds, shoots, pith, flowers, insects (termites and ants), bark and, on occasion, the meat of slow loris (Fox <em>et al</em>. 2004, Wich <em>et al</em>. 2006, Morrogh-Bernard <em>et al</em>. 2009, Hardus <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Female home ranges vary in size from 0.8–1.5 km². The true extent of male home range size is not fully known, although ranges well in excess of 30 km² are inferred (Singleton and van Schaik 2001, Singleton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Females first give birth at about 15 years of age (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2009). Sumatran Orangutans have the longest interbirth intervals of any mammalian species, ranging from 8.2 to 9.3 years (compared with 6.1 to 7.7 years for <em>P. pygmaeus</em>; Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2009, van Noordwijk and van Schaik 2005). Gestation lasts approximately 254 days (Kingsley 1981). Infants are weaned at <em>ca </em>7 years. On average, a female bears 4–5 offspring during her lifetime. Males mature at about about 14 years (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004). They exhibit bimaturism, whereby fully flanged adult males and smaller unflanged males are both capable of reproducing, but employ differing mating strategies (Utami <em>et al</em>. 2002, Utami Atmoko <em>et al</em>. 2009). Longevity in the wild has been estimated at 53 years for females and 58 years for males (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2004). Generation length is at least 25 years (Wich <em>et </em>al. 2004, 2009). <br> </br> The Sumatran Orangutan's survival is seriously threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2011, 2016). Forests continue to be cleared at the large and medium scale for oil-palm plantations that can each cover hundreds of square kilometres. On a smaller scale, logging for timber (both legal and illegal) remains a threat, as does the creation of new roads, which fragment populations and gives access to illegal settlements and further encroachment for agriculture and plantations (also frequently illegal), and to wildlife poachers. When industrial plantations are established, the resident orangutans are forced to seek refuge in adjacent forest patches, if any remain, but in the long term they are likely to succumb to malnutrition and starvation due to competition and limited resources. Such forest fragments are often subsequently cleared as well.<br/><br/>Sumatran Orangutans are frequently killed deliberately, completely illegally, and surviving infants end up in an illegal pet trade. This trade tends to be a by-product of habitat conversion, for example, if an Orangutan is found in an isolated patch of trees during the conversion process, there is a high probability it will be killed. Sumatran Orangutans are also regularly killed in human-wildlife conflict situations, for example, if raiding fruit crops on farmland at the forest edge&#160;(Wich <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/> <br/>By far the largest single current threat to the Sumatran Orangutan comes from a spatial land-use plan ratified by the government of Aceh Province in 2013. Conservation of the Leuser Ecosystem being obligated by Aceh’s own special autonomy law (Law No 11 2006) due to its designation in 2007/8 as a National Strategic Area for its environmental function (which requires its inclusion and special consideration at all levels of spatial planning). But alarmingly the current Aceh spatial plan completely ignores the Leuser Ecosystem’s existence. Both the provincial and national governments have publicly acknowledged the illegality of the Aceh spatial plan, but to date it remains officially ratified at the provincial level and has not been formally cancelled by the national government. As of early 2016, legal challenges are attempting to rectify this situation and to have the current Aceh spatial plan replaced with one that complies fully with all relevant laws, is based on sound environmental sensitivity analyses, and affords appropriate protection to the Leuser Ecosystem in accordance with existing legislation. However, whilst the status quo persists, the Aceh Provincial Spatial Plan of 2013 allows huge tracts of Sumatran Orangutan habitat to be designated for new plantations, and timber and mining concessions, and will lead to many more Sumatran Orangutans being lost in the ensuing years (Wich <em>et al</em>. 2016). The existing plan also effectively legitimizes numerous roads cut illegally through the forest, which further fragment Orangutan populations and provide yet more access to hunting and encroachment."
        , "Although the Saiga currently does not meet the Red List Criteria thresholds for Critically Endangered, the previous assessment of CR A2acd is retained in this assessment because this reassessment falls under the IUCN’s five year rule. This rule applies to taxa that appear to be genuinely improving in status, and states that “a taxon may be moved from a category of higher threat to a category of lower threat if and when none of the criteria of the higher category has been met for five years or more”. The Saiga is considered to have crossed the thresholds between CR and EN around 2015, therefore its status will be re-evaluated again in 2020. Saiga currently meets the thresholds for Endangered under criterion A4 based on observed, estimated and projected declines of &gt;50% over 11 years (three generations), commencing from May 2015, due to the risk of mass mortality events (MME) resulting from outbreaks of disease, exacerbated by climatic and environmental factors, and taking place alongside ongoing poaching pressure for the illegal trade in horns. Saiga populations are inherently vulnerable to mass mortality from a range of diseases. Since 2010, four disease outbreaks have caused large-scale mortality in Saiga. The most severe resulted in the death of over 200,000 Saiga in the course of three weeks in May 2015. The cause of this outbreak (and suspected in the earlier two) has been shown to be haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by the bacterium <em>Pasteurella multocida</em>, which is endemic in Saiga. Lethal levels of infection are believed to have been triggered by environmental conditions including abnormally high humidity and temperature. Warm and wet climatic conditions are expected to increase in frequency due to effects of recorded and predicted climate change. The most recent MME occurred in the Mongolian population in early 2017, caused by PPR, and killed an estimated 54% of the population. Saiga are also subject to strong commercial hunting pressure and the survival of viable populations is entirely dependent on stringent implementation of conservation measures. <br> </br> The Saiga is a nomadic herding species that inhabits open dry steppe grasslands and semi-arid deserts of Central Asia. Typical habitat consists of flat open areas covered with low-growing vegetation, allowing animals to run quickly; areas of broken terrain or dense cover are generally avoided, but animals may stray into these out of necessity or shelter in them during strong winds, they range from near or below sea level in the Caspian basin to ca. 1600 m in Mongolia (Heptner <em>et al. </em>1961, Bekenov <em>et al. </em>1998).<br/><br/>Saiga are migratory, with most populations having widely separated summer (northern) and winter (southern) ranges. The species lives in large herds, usually up to thousands of individuals. It has a high rate of reproduction and recruitment since females usually breed at 7-8 months and males in their second year (Heptner <em>et al. </em>1961) and females often bear twins. In years with a favourable climate the population can increase by up to 60% in a single year (Chan <em>et al.</em> 1995). Very few animals in a population are more than 3.5 years old, indicating that the population is almost completely renewed after four years (Bekenov <em>et al.</em> 1998). Males defend a harem of 5-10 females and gestation lasts about 5 months (Heptner <em>et al.</em> 1961). Saiga are grazers and have been recorded feeding on a wide range of grasses and herbaceous plant species.<br/><br/>For full details of the biology of the species see Heptener <em>et al.</em> (1961) and Sokolov and Zhirnov (1998). <br> </br> Uncontrolled illegal hunting for horns and meat since the break-up of the former USSR has led to the catastrophic fall in Saiga numbers. Selective hunting of young males and subsequent distortion of the sex ratio has also affected reproduction by heavily skewing the sex ratio (Milner-Gulland <em>et al.</em> 2003). A second significant threat is the destruction of key habitats and traditional migration routes. The recent increase in steppe fires is a further cause for concern. <br/><br/>Extreme climatic events, pose a threat, drought in summer and severe winters, especially heavy snow or ‘<em>dzuud</em>’ or ‘<em>dzut</em>’ conditions when an ice-crust forms on top of snow and impedes access to forage. Several resulting instances of mass-mortality are known, such as the winter of 1953/54 in Kazakhstan when 80,000 animals died (Heptner <em>et al.</em> 1961).<br/><br/>Saiga are susceptible to several diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease, brucellosis and others, which may also cause large numbers of deaths. There have been four recent mass-mortality events (MME). In 2010, around two-thirds of a calving aggregation of 20,000 in the Ural population died of a peracute respiratory disease with bloat, and this was followed in 2011 by a smaller die-off of several hundreds of Saiga with similar clinical signs, immediately after calving, and grazing in the exact same location as the earlier MME, suggesting a site-specific cause. Pasteurellosis was implicated based on clinical signs and bacteriology, but very little pathology was undertaken (Kock <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/><br/>In 2015, more than 200,000 Saiga died within three weeks in central Kazakhstan. The proximate cause of death, based on multiple strands of evidence, was confirmed as haemorrhagic septicaemia caused by the bacterium <em>Pasteurella multocida</em> type B (Kock <em>et al.</em> 2018). Statistical modelling suggests that there was unusually high relative humidity and temperature in the days leading up to the outbreak; temperature and humidity anomalies were also observed in two previous similar events in the same region. The modelled influence of environmental covariates is consistent with known drivers of haemorrhagic septicemia. Given the Saiga population’s vulnerability to mass mortality and the likely exacerbation of climate-related and environmental stressors in the future, management of risks to population viability, such as poaching and viral livestock disease, is urgently needed, as well as robust ongoing veterinary surveillance (Kock<em> et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>On 22nd December 2016 the first death of a Mongolian Saiga (<em>S. t. mongolica</em>) was reported by herders to the local authorities in Darvi Soum in the Khuisiin Gobi. Hundreds of live and dead Saiga were subsequently observed with a PPR-like syndrome and signs. Samples were confirmed at the Mongolia State Central Veterinary Laboratory (SCVL) on 6th January 2017 to contain PPR virus and gene sequencing confirmed the virus to be of high similarity to the virus recorded in sheep and goats. The Saiga infection developed rapidly into a full-blown epidemic and by the end of January; death and infection were reported across most of the Saiga range (Kock 2017). Based on carcass counts, over 54% of the population is estimated to have died."
        , "A member of the order Carnivora, Giant Pandas have evolved to specialize on a diet of bamboo (Schaller <em>et al.</em> 1985). Bamboo is a poor food source, low in protein and high in lignin and cellulose, and wild Giant Pandas can only digest an average of 17% of dry matter and about 27% of hemi-cellulose (Dierenfeld <em>et al.</em> 1982, Schaller <em>et al</em>. 1985). Thus, to meet their daily energy requirement, Giant Pandas must consume a large amount of bamboo, up to 12.5 kg per day, and defecate more than 100 times daily (Schaller <em>et al.</em> 1985). Pandas have large, muscular jaws with skeletal features to accommodate the musculature and its famous “pseudothumb” used to hold and manipulate bamboo for processing. However, compared with other herbivores, the Panda has very low digestive efficiency because its digestive tract still resembles that of its carnivorous ancestors. The Panda’s feeding strategy emphasizes volume, requiring it to allocate much of its time to foraging (approximately 14 hours daily).<br/><br/>While morphological and behavioural adaptations provide some compensation for poor digestive efficiency, the Panda’s ability to survive on such a low-quality food source remained mysterious for decades. Even whole-genome sequencing found no specific genes responsible for the digestion of cellulose and hemi-cellulose (Li <em>et al.</em> 2010). An explanation was uncovered in a recent metagenomics study that found the Panda’s gut microbes play an important role in digesting bamboo fibers (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2011a). Additional adaptations to poor quality diet are found in the Panda’s extreme strategy of energy conservation, with daily energy expenditure comparable to that of a sloth or reptile (Nie <em>et al.</em> 2015). Pandas demonstrate a suite of adaptations to reduce energy expenditure. The thick pelage conserves energy lost through body heat, and it has long been known that pandas are conservative in movement and physical activity. Smaller than expected organs also are indicative of energy-conservation adaptation, and down-regulation of resting metabolic rate has been achieved through a mutation in the synthesis pathway for thyroid hormones.<br/><br/>Giant Pandas also compensate for digestive inefficiency by selecting the most nutritious parts of bamboo plants and by altering diet selection seasonally commensurate with changes in nutritional profiles of bamboo species (Schaller<em> et al.</em> 1985, Pan <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 1999, Nie <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015b). They demonstrate strong preference for seasonally available new bamboo shoots, rich in nutrition and energy and low in fibre. Outside the late spring bamboo shoot season, Pandas favour leaves, although more stems are incorporated into their diet during the winter months when leaf quality and quantity diminishes. This convergence of foraging strategies across variations in climate, bamboo species, and topographic profile indicates an adaptive strategy that serves the species well. Still, as an energy-limited species that spends more than 50% of its time foraging, Panda numbers may be limited by the availability of high quality bamboo and the time required to process bamboo in the digestive system.<br/><br/>Early coarse-scale radio tracking using VHF transmitters provided foundational data on home range size and documented the solitary nature of the Panda’s existence (Schaller<em> et al</em>. 1985, Yong <em>et al. </em>1994, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014). Although Panda home ranges overlap generously, direct encounters between individuals are rare. Seasonal elevational migration has been documented in the Qionglai (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985) and Qinling mountains (Yong <em>et al.</em> 1994, Liu <em>et al.</em> 2002, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014). At both sites, the seasonal movements track changes in resources, providing access to bamboo species that provide greater nutritional value. Research integrating behavioural, nutritional, and movement data provide new insights into these seasonal migration patterns, demonstrating that these movements facilitate consumption of higher concentrations and/or a more balanced intake of key nutrients such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Calcium (Ca) (Nie <em>et al.</em> 2014). Female-biased dispersal has been demonstrated with genetic data in the Minshan and Liangshan Mountains (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2007, Hu <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>Fine-scale documentation of |Panda movement behaviour had to await the advent of Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. Published accounts using high-resolution GPS telemetry revised and added to previous findings (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Hull <em>et al. </em>2015). VHF-based radio tracking inevitably leads to large amounts of missing data when animals at more distant locations are not detected, thus it is unsurprising that GPS tracking substantively revised home range size upwards, and that core area overlap and opportunity for social interactions is now understood to be greater than previously believed. Other interesting phenomena were also detected, such as the documentation of female-biased dispersal (confirmed with genetic data; Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2007), and sudden, large movements that temporarily took a female far outside of her home range during the mating season. Fine-scale movement data showed that Pandas exhibited individualistic and multiphasic movement paths within seasonal core habitats and large-scale movements between habitats. Tortuous movement paths indicated when pandas searched for and found foraging resources. Pandas frequently return to the same foraging patches, indicating that they likely have well-developed spatial memory.<br/><br/>Using various measures of habitat suitability, efforts to map Panda habitat have proven valuable for guiding the establishment of the Panda reserve system (Shen <em>et al.</em> 2008, Feng <em>et al.</em> 2009, Qi <em>et al.</em> 2012). Giant Pandas typically occupy temperate montane forests at altitudes of 1,500–3,000 m (Hu and Wei 2004). Range-wide analysis of ecological covariates associated with Panda presence suggested that Giant Pandas are associated with old growth forests, a finding previously unrecognised in studies implemented on smaller spatial scales (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2011). As an obligate bamboo specialist, the Giant Panda’s reliance on this resource is clear, yet it has usually been ignored in habitat suitability models because mapping bamboo understory using remote sensing techniques is difficult (Linderman<em> et al. </em>2005). Including understory bamboo in habitat models dramatically decreases estimates of available habitat and increases measures of fragmentation. Advances in remote sensing techniques, such as Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI), combined with new analytical techniques, such as artificial neural network analysis, have helped remove obstacles to including bamboo understory in maps of habitat suitability (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2009; Viña <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2010). Enhanced understanding of Panda habitat requirements and improvements in mapping technologies provide managers and policy makers with better tools for conservation decision-making (Loucks <em>et al.</em> 2003, Xu <em>et al.</em> 2006, Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2011, Qi <em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>Giant Pandas are a solitary and seasonal-breeding mammal, only coming together during the breeding season, from March to May, for reproductive purposes (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014, Nie <em>et al.</em> 2012b). Male Pandas occupy large home ranges overlapping several females and are known to congregate around oestrous females. Male Pandas are able to locate females across large areas, and demonstrate fierce and injurious aggression in competition for access to females. Early in these encounters escalated aggression is common, but, in a possible strategy to conserve energy and minimize risk of injury, once dominance is established, contact aggression is largely replaced with non-contact aggression. Individual males are able to locate and mate with multiple females sequentially, so the mating system might be considered scramble competition polygyny.<br/><br/>Because Pandas live a solitary existence, they must rely heavily on chemosignals to communicate with one another without necessitating face-to-face encounters. Giant Pandas make use of a system of traditional communal scent mark stations that provide them with reliable locations they can visit to deposit signals and investigate signals left by other Pandas (Schaller<em> et al. </em>1985). Studies documenting habitat characteristics of preferred marking sites, including tree species and microhabitat (Nie <em>et al. </em>2012a), extend our understanding of habitat requirements for the species. If habitat that promotes communication is not maintained, then poor communication may hinder breeding in the wild, as has been shown for captive Pandas (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Denning ecology is an important field of study among ursids, and other species giving birth in dens, because access to adequate dens can be important for offspring survival. Forest management practices that affect the availability of suitable dens can either significantly harm or enhance cub survival (White<em> et al. </em>2001). Ursid young, being extremely altricial, are particularly vulnerable. The Giant Panda lies at the extreme end of this continuum, with the mother weighing nearly 1,000 times the cub’s weight at birth (Gittleman 1994). Den quality may therefore be critical for Pandas. Giant Pandas do not hibernate, but females use rock caves or tree cavities to rear offspring that are produced every 2–3 years (Schaller<em> et al. </em>1985, Pan <em>et al. </em>2014, Zhu <em>et al. </em>2001). Preferred dens are characterized by a small opening to buffer against the elements and provide a warmer and drier environment for rearing offspring (Zhang<em> et al. </em>2007). Dens tend to be located close to water, presumably so the mother can leave the vulnerable cub (almost always a single cub) unattended for a shorter period of time while she drinks. It has also been proposed that tree dens, once more numerous in primary forests before logging converted many forests in Panda habitat to second growth, are a limiting resource for Giant Pandas (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2011). The importance of this resource may explain why national survey data indicate that pandas are more often found in primary than secondary forest.<br/><br/>It was once believed, and sometimes still mis-stated, that Pandas’ biological deficiencies were responsible for their own decline. Because of early problems with captive breeding, Pandas gained a reputation for having notoriously low levels of interest in mating; however, Pandas in the wild experience no mating problems and have high reproductive rates (Wei and Hu 1994, Pan <em>et al</em>. 2014). Once a better understanding of the biology and behaviour of the species was incorporated into husbandry practices, captive Pandas began to mate naturally and experienced exponential population growth (Swaisgood <em>et al.</em> 2006, Zhang and Wei 2006, Martin-Wintle <em>et al.</em> 2016). Moreover, its well-known specialization on bamboo is not (as once thought) an evolutionary cul de sac, as it opens up a foraging niche with plentiful resources and few competitors (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2014). Dietary specialization is often seen as an extinction risk factor, but this may not be the case for the Panda, which specializes on widespread and abundant bamboo. Thus, pandas are well-adapted to their environment and have reproductive rates sufficiently high to explain the recovery of populations once bans on poaching and habitat restoration efforts commenced (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2014). <br> </br> The primary threat facing Giant Panda populations is the continuing effects of previous habitat loss, resulting in highly fragmented habitat and, in many cases small, isolated populations. According to the Fourth National Survey (State Forestry Administration 2015), the Panda population is composed of as many as 33 subpopulations, 18 of which contain fewer than 10 individuals. The extent to which these are demographically separate populations remains uncertain, but this fragmentation certainly increases vulnerability to extinction through environmental and demographic stochasticity and loss of genetic diversity.<br/><br/>Although microsatellite analysis (Lü <em>et al.</em> 2001, Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Shan <em>et al.</em> 2014) and genomics (Li <em>et al.</em> 2010, Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2013) have now determined that the Giant Panda has substantial genetic variability, without increased migration and connectivity, many of these smaller populations will have rapidly eroding evolutionary potential. Three genetic clusters have been recognized: the Qinling Mountains population (Lü <em>et al.</em> 2001, Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007) which diverged ~0.3 million years ago; the Mishan mountains, which diverged ~2,800 years ago into the Mishan and Qionglai populations (Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Zhao <em>et al.</em> 2013); and the other four combined populations, including Qionglai, Daxiangling, Xiaoziangling, and Liangshan (Zhan <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, in this larger cluster, further sub-structuring is manifest (Zhang, B. <em>et al.</em> 2007, Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2011b). Population divergence is the product of several operating factors, including climate change, natural barriers, and anthropogenic habitat loss.<br/><br/>Threats associated with edge effects, human disturbance, and small population size are most severe in these small, isolated populations. Increased fragmentation from roads, hydroelectric dams, mining, and other infrastructure projects further threaten Panda populations (State Forestry Administration 2015), but these trends are partially counterbalanced through the successful implementation of ecocompensation programs that curtail some activities such as fuel wood collection (Viña <em>et al.</em> 2007) and efforts to increase habitat connectivity between some populations (Wang <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a). Tourism is increasing in some areas and if not managed properly, could negatively impact Panda populations (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2012). Pathogens and parasites may be an emerging problem compromising Giant Panda health and survival, particularly in areas where dogs, livestock, and other domesticated animals may introduce novel pathogens (Qin <em>et al.</em> 2010; Zhang, L. <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2015). Air- or water-borne environmental contaminants may also exert negative impacts on Panda populations, but little is known about their prevalence. Livestock grazing, inside and outside of protected areas, represents another, potentially growing threat (Hull <em>et al.</em> 2014, Wang <em>et al.</em> 2015). It should also be noted that protected status of nature reserves does not always confer protection, and some threats have continued even after Panda reserves were gazetted (Liu <em>et al.</em> 2001). These continuing human activities may have cumulative effects that further degrade Panda habitat.<br/><br/>Pandas' reliance on bamboo as a primary food source puts them at risk during this plant's characteristic mass synchronous flowering and die-off events, which occur at intervals of 15 to 100 years (Schaller <em>et al. </em>1985, Reid <em>et al.</em> 1989). Before human expansion confined Pandas to high elevations, Pandas had access to more species of bamboo adapted to different elevation zones. When one bamboo species experienced a die-off, Pandas could easily migrate up or down slope to access a different species that was not affected. Confined to its more limited elevation range today, Pandas are sometimes put at risk of starvation, especially when more than one bamboo species flowers at the same time. Although past bamboo die-off events were alarming and caused starvation and mortalities in Pandas, populations recovered (Pan <em>et al.</em> 2014) and these population bottlenecks did not compromise genetic diversity (Zhu <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>These primary threats associated with habitat fragmentation and degradation may be exacerbated by climate change-mediated effects on Panda habitat in the future. Several models indicate significant losses to Giant Panda habitat, with estimates of loss of bamboo habitat ranging from 37% to 100% by the end of the century (Fan <em>et al.</em> 2012, Songer <em>et al.</em> 2012, Tuanmu <em>et al.</em> 2013, Li, R. <em>et al.</em> 2015). Although these models are simplifying and may not adequately account for distributional shifts of bamboo species adapted to lower elevations and southern latitudes to replace current habitat that might be lost (Wei <em>et al.</em> 2015a), managers should be concerned about large-scale environmental changes facing Panda populations in the future. In addition, climate change may alter the agricultural value of current Giant Panda habitat and bring about intensified human pressure for cultivation. For example, some models indicate that much of Panda habitat will become suitable for viticulture, a high-value crop (Hannah <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Although poaching impacted Pandas in the past (Li <em>et al.</em> 2003), its impact declined rapidly since the enactment of the Wildlife Protection Act, which bans poaching and carries severe punishments. However, Pandas may sometimes be caught in snares set for musk deer or other species."

        "This species has a small range (extent of occurrence is definitely less than 20,000 km² and potentially less than 5,000 km²) and is restricted to a small, fragmented area on the Turkish/Syrian border. The species is undergoing continuing decline from habitat loss (due to agriculture) and persecution. Population densities are believed to be low. In Turkey, the species is very rare; only three localities are known. Due to threats from expanding human settlements and agriculture (including habitat loss, degradation and direct poisoning of the species) the population is declining and its range is shrinking. It is not known if the distribution is severely fragmented, but it is likely that there are fewer than 10 locations. Currently it qualifies for Vulnerable (VU B1ab(ii,iii,v)). <br/><br/>There may be fewer than 2,500 mature individuals in the population, but more data are required to confirm this (N. Yigit pers. comm. 2007). Research is underway for this species, but there is a need for more focus on monitoring to determine population trends. The species should be reassessed in a few years' time. <br> </br> The main distribution area of the golden hamster is the fertile, agricultural and densely populated Aleppinian plateau in Syria, 280-380 m above sea level. The plateau area covers c.10,000-15,000 km<sup>2</sup>. The Turkish and Syrian sites may form a connected distribution area, but data to confirm this cannot easily be obtained because of restricted access to the military-protected border zone between Syria and Turkey (Gattermann <em>et al.</em>, 2001). <br> </br> Reported to be much rarer than the grey hamster (Qumsiyeh, 1996). During two short expeditions to the main distribution area in Syria only a limited number of individuals were found (Gattermann <em>et al.</em>, 2001). Distribution is presumably patchy but the hamsters may be locally abundant based on biological surveys and observations of local farmers; data are insufficient for confirmation (Gattermann <em>et al</em>. 2001). <br> </br> The species is mainly found in arable fields with annual crops such as wheat, barley, chickpeas, lentils, and vegetables (Demirsoy <em>et al.</em>, 2006). Records of steppe populations probably result from confusion with the Turkish hamster <em>Mesocricetus brandti </em>(Gattermann <em>et al</em>. 2001). The golden hamster is a solitary, nocturnal and omnivorous (Qumsiyeh, 1996) species inhabiting burrows which can reach up to nine metres long (Gattermann <em>et al</em>. 2001). Anecdotal evidence from farmers indicates hibernation might occur between November and February (Gattermann <em>et al</em>. 2001). Reproductive activity possibly begins in February. A female with two to three week old juveniles was recorded in late March (Gattermann <em>et al</em>. 2001). <br> </br> Habitat loss caused by increasing human settlements is the main threat to the golden hamster in Syria. The impact of natural predators on hamster populations is probably negligible. Golden hamsters are considered one of the most important agricultural pests and animals are trapped or poisoned in February as soon as burrow entrances become visible. Farmers apply large quantities of rodenticides provided by the government. In May and June most fields are harvested, burnt and ploughed; sheep feed on remaining plants making it increasingly difficult for hamsters to find cover, nutrition or sufficient food for winter storage (Gattermann <em>et al.</em>, 2001). This species is considered a pest in Syria."
        , "The Arctic Fox has a circumpolar distribution in all Arctic tundra habitats, with a global population in the order of several hundred thousand animals. Most populations fluctuate widely in numbers between years in response to varying lemming numbers, but in most areas population status is believed to be good and there is no reason to believe that the species currently qualifies for listing as threatened under any of the criteria. <br> </br> Inhabits Arctic and alpine tundra on the continents of Eurasia, North America and the Canadian archipelago, Siberian islands, Greenland, inland Iceland and Svalbard, and Sub-Arctic maritime habitat in the Aleutian island chain, Bering Sea Islands, Commander Islands and coastal Iceland. <br/><br/>The Arctic Fox is an opportunistic predator and scavenger but in most inland areas, the species is heavily dependent on fluctuating rodent populations. The species' main prey items include lemmings, both <em>Lemmus</em> spp. and <em>Dicrostonyx</em> spp. (Macpherson 1969, Angerbjörn <em>et al.</em> 1999). In Fennoscandia, <em>Lemmus lemmus</em> was the main prey in summer (85% frequency of occurrence in faeces) followed by birds (Passeriformes, Galliformes and Caridriiformes, 34%) and reindeer (<em>Rangifer tarandus</em>) (21%; Elmhagen <em>et al</em>. 2000). In winter, ptarmigan and grouse (<em>Lagopus</em> spp.) are common prey in addition to rodents and reindeer (Kaikusalo and Angerbjörn 1995). Changes in fox populations have been observed to follow those of their main prey in three- to five-year cycles (Macpherson 1969, Angerbjörn <em>et al</em>. 1999, 2013) with up to 20 cubs produced by a single female (Tannerfeldt and Angerbjörn 1998).<br/><br/>Foxes living near ice-free coasts have access to both inland prey and sea birds, seal carcasses, fish and invertebrates connected to the marine environment, leading to relatively stable food availability and a more generalist strategy (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1996). In late winter and summer, foxes found in coastal Iceland feed on seabirds (<em>Uria aalge</em>, <em>U. lomvia</em>), seal carcasses and marine invertebrates. Inland foxes rely more on ptarmigan in winter, and migrant birds, such as geese and waders, in summer (Hersteinsson and Macdonald 1996). In certain areas, foxes rely on colonies of Arctic geese, which can dominate their diet locally (Samelius and Lee 1998).&#160;Some populations switch between lemmings, migratory birds and marine resources depending on intra- and interannual variations in prey availability. The Arctic Fox depends also on remains of carrion left by larger predators, e.g. Polar Bear, Grey Wolf <em>Canis lupus</em>, and Wolverine <em>Gulo gulo</em>. It is itself a victim of predation, mainly from Red Fox, Wolverine, Golden Eagle, and humans. <br> </br> Hunting for fur has long been a major mortality factor for the Arctic Fox. With the decline of the fur hunting industry, the threat of over-exploitation is lowered for most Arctic Fox populations. They may also be subject to direct persecution (as on St. Paul Island). Misinformation as to the origin of Arctic Foxes on the Pribilofs continues to foster negative attitudes and the long-term persistence of this endemic subspecies is in jeopardy. In areas connected to marine ecosystems, Arctic Foxes may also be affected by indirect threats, such as diseases and the effects of persistent organic pollutants (Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2008); indeed, an emerging threat in Fennoscandia is the impact of sarcoptic mange on populations (Mörner 1992).&#160;In some areas, gene swamping by farm-bred blue foxes (see Conservation) may threaten native populations (Norén&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009)."
        , "This species is listed as Critically Endangered because of&#160;an ongoing population reduction. In the last ten years (a period exceeding three generations) this is inferred to have resulted in the loss of over half the population, and it is predicted to intensify in the next&#160;ten years&#160;to result in a decline rate exceeding 80% because of habitat degradation/loss and the effects of introduced species, notably American Mink <em>Neovison vison</em>. <br> </br> European Mink has&#160;specialised habitat requirements. It is&#160;semi-aquatic, inhabiting densely vegetated banks of rivers, streams and sometimes, during the warm season, it may inhabit lake-banks. It is rarely found more than 100 meters away from fresh water. There are no records of its presence on sea coast.&#160;It hunts&#160;both in riparian zones and in the water for amphibians, crustaceans (crayfish), fish, small mammals, insects and birds (Sidorovich <span >et al</span>. 1998, Maran <span >et al</span>. 1998; Palazón <span >et al</span>. 2004, 2008). Females become mature for the next breeding season at 11 months (T. Maran unpublished). <br> </br> The decline and extinction of the European Mink cannot be explained with a single universal factor. The main factors operating the extinction have been (1) habitat loss, (2) over-exploitation and (3) impact of alien American Mink.<br/><br/>In the European continent, human activities have resulted in large-scale alteration of landscapes, which has had a substantial impact on various habitats and their species. The European Mink has proved to be sensitive to human-induced environmental change and disturbance. As the type and extent of human influence on the species and its biotope has varied in time and between regions in Europe, also the set of factors contributing to the extinction has varied.<br/><br/>Several factors have often been acting in concert with a cumulative effect. The course of decline during the first half of 20th century in central regions of Russia is a perfect illustration of this. There, the effect of over-exploitation was noticed almost throughout the entire European Mink range (this even resulted in a moratorium of hunting in several regions and even in reinforcement efforts in Yaroslavl Region, where around 130 European Minks&#160;were translocated with the hope to recover the original, depleted population). In addition, extensive change of habitats in the mid-20th century further contributed to the decline. Thereafter, the invasion of the American Mink posed a very serious threat to the native mink. Large-scale introductions&#160;of American Mink in Russia, first planned to be conducted only in regions outside the European Mink's natural range, were ultimately performed also inside the native mink range. The reason for this was twofold: (1) the original mink has become too scarce for the fur-trapping industry, (2) higher value of American Mink fur in the market (Pavlov and Korsakova 1973). In these times, the American Mink and European Mink were not regarded by the relevant authorities to be two distinct species. In the course of the introduction operation, 20,400 American Mink were released in the USSR until 1971, with around 4,000 of them being released into the range of the European Mink (Pavlov and Korsakova 1973). The intentional introduction of the alien species was strongly supported by rapidly developing mink fur-farming in the Soviet Union – escapees from farms formed a continuous source of new founders for introduction. American Mink farming started in the 1920s; in 1972, 1.9 million female American Minks&#160;were kept in fur-farms and in 1973, 4.9 million minks&#160;were raised in 146 farms in the former Soviet Union (Abramov 1974). As the native mink populations were small and highly fragmented by over-exploitation and habitat loss, the fur-farm escapees, being ecologically more flexible (Maran 1991) easily invaded into the freely available ecological niche, thus making it impossible for the depleted European Mink to recover. Even more, the remaining European Mink groups were an easy target for intra-guild aggression (Maran <span >et al</span>. 1991, 1998; Sidorovich <span >et al</span>. 1999, 2001). The magnitude of the effect of mink farming on the native mink is well illustrated by a recent study in Denmark (a country with a very high number of mink farms), which concludes that 86% of free-living American Minks&#160;are escapees from farms (Hammershoj <span >et al</span>. 2005).<br/><br/>Local key factors have changed with time also in many other countries. For instance the impact of over-hunting and/or habitat change weakened the populations and accelerated the impact of the subsequent spread of the American Mink and/or the impact of other factors. It might well be that sometimes the interchange of key factors in time and/or the concurrent impact of several factors has led to a synergistic effect on the European Mink. Further, the time from the introduction of the threat to the extinction of the species can be highly variable, resulting in the so-called extinction or decline lag (Baillie <span >et al</span>. 2004). This, along with the interwoven effect of numerous factors, is likely to result in situations when it is hard or, in some cases, even impossible to identify the actual causes behind the extinction process.<br/><br/>The role of the alien American Mink deserves a special attention. Its role has been noted in several reports as a secondary or unimportant factor, usually emphasising that the decline of the European Mink started before the invasion of American Mink (Lodé 2002, Lodé <span >et al</span>. 2001, Rozhnov 1992, Schubnikova 1982). Still, there are several records of local extinction of the European Mink concurrent with rapid expansion of the American Mink, e.g., in Estonia, Tver Region in Russia, Basque country (Zadorra river basin and Cantabric rivers in Bizkaia province) in Spain, Belarus (Maran 1991,&#160;Sidorovich 1991, 1993;&#160;Katchanovsky 2002, Palazón&#160;<span >et al</span>. 2002, 2004;&#160;Põdra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013,&#160;Zuberogoitia <em>et al</em>. 2013, A Gomez pers. comm, 2014). The former range of European Mink included a number of large nature reserves where habitat alteration and hunting were minimal or absent (Maran <em>et al</em>, 1998, Maran 1992). Further, although there are 'time-shot' records on the co-existence of the two mink species, no records demonstrating long-term sympatric coexistence of the two mink species have been found. Numerous records reveal the local replacement of the European Mink with the American Mink, but no opposite events have been reported. Records on replacement of the European Mink with the American Mink are further supported by studies of behavioural interactions between the two mink species in the wild and well as in experimental conditions. All this evidences that the American Mink has played a special role in the demise of the European Mink. While most of the other agents which have been operating the extinction are relatively easy to stop by conventional conservation management, there is very little one can do to prevent the spread of the alien American Mink. This means that the presence of the American Mink in wide territories across Europe makes the efforts for species recovery a very complicated task.<br/><br/>A new complication is the rising trend for private individuals in France&#160;to keep&#160;American Mink&#160;as a pet.<br/><br/>In addition to the main factors behind the decline of European Mink populations, a number of other factors may pose local threat the remaining small populations, like hybridisation, road casualties, Aleutian disease and secondary poisoning.<br/><br/>Habitat loss and degradation is still a serious threat especially in western populations, both in France and in Spain (mostly in Cantabric rivers). "
        , "Loss of Arctic sea ice due to climate change is the most serious threat to Polar Bears throughout their circumpolar range (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Stirling and Derocher 2012, USFWS 2015). We performed a data-based sensitivity analysis with respect to this threat by evaluating the potential response of the global Polar Bear population to projected sea-ice conditions. Our analyses included a comprehensive assessment of generation length (GL) for Polar Bears; development of a standardized sea-ice metric representing important habitat characteristics for the species; and population projections, over three Polar Bear generations, using computer simulation and statistical models representing alternative relationships between sea ice and Polar Bear abundance.<br/><br/>Our analyses highlight the potential for large reductions in the global Polar Bear population if sea-ice loss continues, which is forecast by climate models and other studies (IPCC 2013). Our analyses also highlight the large amount of uncertainty in statistical projections of Polar Bear abundance and the sensitivity of projections to plausible alternative assumptions. Across six scenarios that projected polar bear abundance three generations forward in time using the median and 95th percentile of estimated GL, the median probability of a reduction in the mean global population size greater than 30% was approximately 0.71 (range 0.20-0.95; see Table 4 in the attached Supporting Material). The median probability of a reduction greater than 50% was approximately 0.07 (range 0-0.35), and the probability of a reduction greater than 80% was negligible. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List Guidelines suggests that assessors consider nearly the full range of uncertainty in potential outcomes, and adopt a precautionary but realistic attitude toward risk tolerance (Section 3.2.3, IUCN 2014). In light of the significant probability, across scenarios, of a reduction in mean global population size greater than 30%, and the relatively low probability of a reduction greater than 50%, we conclude that Polar Bears currently warrant listing as Vulnerable under criterion A3c (IUCN 2014). <br> </br> Polar Bears occur at low densities throughout the circumpolar Arctic and are more abundant in shallower, ice-covered waters associated with the continental shelf where currents or upwellings increase biological productivity. Seasonally, in the summer open water season, Polar Bears may be found on land in higher densities.<br/><br/>The Polar Bear is a K-selected species with late sexual maturity, small litter size, high maternal investment and high adult survival. The Polar Bear’s reproductive rate is among the lowest in all mammals (Bunnell and Tait 1981) although similar to that of other ursids. Females generally mature at 4-5 years, and enter a prolonged oestrus between late March and early June, although most mating occurs in April and early May. Ovulation is induced by mating (Stirling 2009), and implantation is delayed until autumn. The total gestation period ranges between 195-265 days (Uspenski 1977, Amstrup 2003). Whether or not the embryo implants and proceeds to develop is likely determined by body condition. Pregnant females enter dens in snow drifts or slopes on land, close to the sea (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), or on sea ice (in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas) as early as September/October, but more typically in late autumn (Lentfer and Hensel 1980, Amstrup and Gardner 1994, Wiig 1998). Females give birth inside the den, usually in late December to early January (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1992, Amstrup 2003). Polar Bears most often give birth to twin cubs; singleton and triplet litters are less frequent. Newborn Polar Bears are blind, sparsely haired and weigh approximately 0.6 kg (Blix and Lentfer 1979). They grow rapidly, fed on rich milk from their mother (36% fat; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1993), and when they emerge from the den sometime between early March and late April (Pedersen 1945, Wiig 1998), they weigh 10-12 kg (Amstrup 2003). In some regions, after emerging from the den, the female may not have fed for a period up to 8 months, which may be the longest period of food deprivation for any mammal (Watts and Hansen 1987).<br/><br/>Cub mortality is high in the first year (Larsen 1985, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), with the probability of cub survival largely determined by maternal condition. Mothers with larger fat stores in the fall emerge in the spring with larger cubs which are more likely to survive (Atkinson and Ramsay 1995, Derocher and Stirling 1998, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012a). The young usually stay with their mother for two years (Lønø 1970, Stirling et al. 1976, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), and consequently females on average do not enter a new reproductive cycle more often than every third year most places (Amstrup 2003). In contrast to their low reproductive rates, adult Polar Bears have high survival rates (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Polar Bears are the most carnivorous of the extant species of bears. Throughout their range, Ringed Seals (<em>Phoca hispida</em>), preferably young-of-the-year, and to a lesser extent Bearded Seals (<em>Erignathus barbatus</em>) are their primary prey (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2002, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). In some areas they are also known to take Harp Seals (<em>Pagophilus groenlandicus</em>), Hooded Seals (<em>Cystophora cristata</em>), and even larger species such as Walrus (<em>Odobenus rosmarus</em>) and Beluga (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>) (Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). Polar Bears digest fat more efficiently than protein (Best 1984). Polar Bears are large when compared to other ursid species, which is a consequence of their energy-rich diet. Although birds, fish, vegetation and kelp are eaten where locally available during the ice free-season (Pedersen 1945, Russell 1975, Dyck and Romberg 2007, Born <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gormezano and Rockwell 2013), it is unlikely that Polar Bears would be capable of gaining enough nutritional benefit to survive on a primarily terrestrial diet (Ramsay and Hobson 1991, Hobson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010b, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2015). <br> </br> Anthropogenic and natural changes in Arctic environments, as well as recognition of the shortcomings of our knowledge of Polar Bear ecology, are increasing the challenges for Polar Bear conservation and management. Higher ambient temperatures and erratic weather fluctuations, symptoms of anthropogenic climate change, are increasing across the range of polar bears. Polar Bears are dependent upon Arctic sea ice for access to their prey. Their dependence on an ephemeral habitat that exists as a function of sea surface and atmospheric temperatures means that climate warming poses the single most important threat to the long-term persistence of Polar Bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Arctic sea ice loss has thus far progressed faster than most climate models have predicted (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2007) with September sea extent declining at a linear rate of 14% per decade from 1979 through 2011 (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2014). Because changes in sea-ice are known to alter Polar Bear abundance, productivity, body condition, and distribution (Stirling <em>et al</em>. 1999, Fischbach <em>et al</em>. 2007, Schleibe <em>et al</em>. 2008, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2010, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2012, 2014b, Bromaghin <em>et al</em>. 2015), continued climate warming will increase future uncertainty and pose severe risks to the welfare of Polar Bear subpopulations (Stirling and Derocher 2012, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2013). Arctic sea ice extent is linearly related to global mean temperature, which in turn, is directly related to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2010). Population and habitat models predict substantial declines in the distribution and abundance of Polar Bears in the future (Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010, Castro de la Guardia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Hamilton et al. 2014). Although Polar Bears living in historically colder regions of the Arctic might derive transient benefit from a climate-driven transition away from multi-year ice (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004), the annual sea ice must persist long enough for Polar Bears to derive benefit from associated changes in seal availability and biological productivity. Recent sea ice simulations suggest large regions of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago will be ice free for &gt;5 months by the late 21<sup>st</sup> century (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2014). In other parts of the Arctic, the 5-month ice-free threshold may be reached by the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Atwood <em>et al</em>. 2015). These studies are based on sea-ice data obtained from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) An annual ice-free period of ≥5 months is likely to lead to extended fasting, which is predicted to lead to increased reproductive failure and starvation (Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014a, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Nevertheless, uncertainty and regional variability in the near-term effects of climate change must be included in Polar Bear management and conservation plans.<br/><br/>Although there have been local and regional studies on polar bear denning habitat (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983, Messier <em>et al</em>. 1994, Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2006, 2013, Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), large scale mapping of Polar Bear denning habitat across the Arctic has not occurred. It is also unknown how climate change will change denning locations and habitats, though predicted increases in forest fires may have adverse effects on maternity denning habitat in sub-Arctic regions (Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2007). Declining sea ice availability can impair the ability of pregnant females to reach traditional denning areas (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2011, Cherry <em>et al</em>. 2013) and increases of rain events will be detrimental for denning Polar Bears (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>The occurrence of diseases and parasites in Polar Bears is rare compared with occurrences in other ursids. However, with warming Arctic temperatures, altered climate could influence&#160; infectious disease epidemiology through mechanisms such as novel pathogen introduction due to range expansion of carrier animals and arthropod vectors; modification of host susceptibility; changes in pathogen evolution, transmission, and number of generations per year; host immunosuppression; shifts in main food sources; altered behaviour; and co-infections with multiple agents (Harvell <em>et al</em>. 2002, Parmesan 2006, Burek <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hueffer <em>et al</em>. 2011). As a result, the potential for exposure to pathogens and resulting disease outbreaks may become more significant threats as Polar Bears experience the cumulative effects of multiple stressors (Patyk <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The warming climate has been associated with an increase in pathogens in other Arctic marine and terrestrial organisms. Parasitic agents that have developmental stages outside the bodies of warm-blooded hosts (e.g., nematodes: Laaksonen <em>et al</em>. 2010) will likely benefit from the warmer and wetter weather projected for the Arctic. Improved conditions for such parasites have already adversely affected the health of some Arctic mammals (Kutz <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bacterial parasites also are likely to benefit from a warmer and wetter Arctic (e.g., <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticu</em>s; Baker-Austin <em>et al</em>. 2012). As the effects of climate change become more prevalent, there is concern about the emergence of new pathogens within polar bear range, new threats from existing pathogens that may be able to infect immuno-compromised/stressed bears, and the potential for new and existing pathogens to cross human–animal boundaries (e.g., giardia). Because of the previous limited exposure of Polar Bears to diseases and parasites (Fagre <em>et al</em>. 2015), researchers have as yet been unable to determine whether they will be more susceptible to new pathogens. However, concern is exacerbated by the fact that Polar Bears appear to have a naïve immune system (Weber <em>et al</em>. 2013), which may make them particularly vulnerable to infection. Many different pathogens have been found in seal species that are Polar Bear prey; the potential therefore exists for transmission of these diseases to Polar Bears (Kirk <em>et al</em>. 2010). If Polar Bears become nutritionally stressed, altered foraging behaviours such as increased feeding on the internal organs of their primary prey and use of alternative foods (e.g., Prop et al. 2015) may increase the potential for exposure to pathogens. Ensuring the long-term persistence of Polar Bears will necessitate understanding how a rapidly changing physical environment modulates exposure to disease risk factors and, ultimately, population health.<br/><br/>Persistent organic pollutants, which reach Arctic regions via long range transport by air and ocean currents as well as river run off, also increase uncertainty for the welfare of polar bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010. Although Polar Bears live in relatively pristine Arctic regions, a variety of industrial toxic substances are brought into Polar Bear management areas from human anthropogenic activities around the world. Polar Bears are apex predators and are therefore exposed to high levels of pollutants, which magnify with each step in the food web resulting in high concentrations in polar bear tissue (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). A key characteristic of these pollutants is that they persist in the environment due to low biotic and abiotic degradation. The contaminant burdens among Polar Bears are known to vary among regions (e.g., Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even where contaminant burdens may be known, their effects on Polar Bear physiol­ogy and health are not well understood (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, Dietz <em>et al</em>. (2015) showed that the risk for reproductive, immune suppressive and carcinogenic effects in polar bear subpopulations across the Arctic are high due to PCB and perflourinated compounds (PFCs) exposure.<br/><br/>Many of the contaminants are lipophilic and bond tightly to lipophilic tissues. Polar Bears are particularly vulnerable to organochlorines because they eat a fat rich diet. Ringed, bearded, and harp seals comprise the main food of Polar Bears and the blubber layer is preferentially eaten by the bears and subsequently, the intake of pollutants is high (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent studies have documented new pollutants in polar bear tissues which expose the species to even more toxic and complex combination of industrial chemicals (Verreault <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2006; Muir <em>et al</em>. 2006; Smithwick <em>et al</em>. 2006; McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Gebbink <em>et al</em>. submitted). The potential for contam­inants to impact Arctic systems is predicted to increase as climate warming alters global circulation and precipitation patterns (Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jenssen <em>et al</em>. 2015) and predicting local and regional effects will become more complicated and uncertain.<br/><br/>A three decade study (1983-2010) of East Greenland Polar Bears revealed both declines of conventional POPs and increases in brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and PFCs (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013a,b; Riget <em>et al</em>. 2013). The last decade has showed climate related increases in PCBs as well as peaks of BFRs and PFCs due to recent industrial reductions (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2013b McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Although the effects of pollutants on polar bears are only partially understood, levels of such pollutants in some subpopulations are already sufficiently high that they may interfere with hormone regulation, immune system function, and possibly reproduction (Wiig <em>et al</em>. 1998; Bernhoft <em>et al</em>. 2000; Skaare <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2001; Gustavson <em>et al</em>. 2015; Henriksen <em>et al</em>. 2001; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2003; Derocher 2005; Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2015; Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2015). There are suggestions that species with delayed implantation are more vulnerable to the effects of pollution through endocrine (hormone) disruption (Knott <em>et al</em>. 2011). Further, because female Polar Bears are food deprived during gestation, their pollution load increases in their blood, when energy and pollutants are mobilized from their adipose tissue. Because the cubs are nursed on fat rich milk they are exposed to very high pollution loads from their mother (Polishuk <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bytingsvik <em>et al</em>. 2012). This may pose the greatest threat to the species as the vulnerability of pre- and neonatal polar bears is the most sensible to life-long health effects from long-range transported pollution which decreases immunity, survival and reproductive success (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne 2010).<br/><br/>An additional emerging threat to Polar Bears is the increase in resource exploration and development in the Arctic along with increased ice-breaking and shipping. There are currently no data on the effects of ice-breaking on habitat use by Polar Bears. Although some studies suggest that Polar Bears are sensitive to localized disturbance at maternity den sites (Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2006), our knowledge about potential effects of large scale development is lacking.<br/><br/>Oil development in the Arctic poses a wide of range of threats to Polar Bears ranging from oil spills to increased human-bear interactions. It is probable that an oil spill in sea ice habitat would result in oil being concentrated in leads and between ice floes resulting in both Plar Bears and their main prey (Ringed Seal and Bearded Seal) being directly exposed to oil. Polar Bears are often attracted by the smells and sound associated with human activity. Polar Bears are known to ingest plastic, styrofoam, lead acid batteries, tin cans, oil, and other hazardous materials with lethal consequences in some cases (Lunn and Stirling 1985, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 1989, Derocher and Stirling 1991). Another concern is that seals covered in oil may be a major source of oil to polar bears. Although the biological threats and impacts of oil and gas activities on Polar Bears are reasonably well understood (Øritsland <em>et al</em>. 1981; Hurst and Øritsland 1982; Stirling 1988, 1990; Isaksen <em>et al</em>. 1998; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2006), mitigation and response plans are currently lacking (but see Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Moreover, how Polar Bears will be affected by other types of human activity are less well known (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Significant portions of the Polar Bear’s range already are being developed and exploration is proposed for many other areas. With warming induced sea ice decline, previously inaccess­ible areas will be exposed to development and other forms of anthropogenic activities (e.g., trans-Arctic shipping, tourism). The direct effects of human activities, the in­creased potential for negative human-bear encounters, and the potential for increased local pollution are all concerns that must be understood if we are to understand and manage impacts on the future for Polar Bears.<br/><br/>Our understanding of Polar Bear population dynamics has improved with ongoing development and refinement of analytical methods (e.g., Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008a,b, 2009; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2001; McDonald and Amstrup 2001; Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2010, 2015; Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009; Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014). These improved and new tools suggest that previous estimates of population parameters and numbers can be biased. Vital rates are subpopulation specific, and different from the generalized rates that were often used to generate previous status reports (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987). For the two subpopulations (Southern Beaufort Sea, Western Hudson Bay) that are known to have been impacted by climate change and where a long time series of abundance exist, harvest represents an additive impact. Illegal take of polar bears in Russia, combined with legal subsistence harvest in the U.S., may exceed sustainable limits for the Chukchi subpopulationIn many cases harvest documentation and the popula­tion data necessary to assess the impact of harvest both are insufficient to allow managers to provide the desired balance between potential yield and take. Given the cultural and eco­nomic importance of Polar Bear hunting in many regions, understanding the potential for and the impact of hunting continues to be a critical part of management (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012.<br/><br/>It is important that subpopulation estimates and projections are based on substantiated scientific data. In some areas, studies to estimate abundance occur infrequently so if the harvest rate is either initially set above the sustainable level or it becomes so, the subpopulation may be reduced before the next inventory is made. In addition, harvest practices may have to be reconsidered given recent knowledge about long-term environmental trends and fluctuations that can affect sustainable removal rates. In some jurisdictions in Canada, the governance system includes aboriginal co-management boards and aboriginal hunting organizations. In some of these co-management systems, both local knowledge and science are to be considered equally in both management and research decisions. Although scientific studies have concluded that the long-term effects of capturing and collaring polar bears are minimal (Ramsay and Stirling 1986, Messier 2000, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2014a), some local groups nevertheless consider these techniques disrespectful or harmful to the animals. As a result, population inventory and ecological studies have been delayed or not permitted. On the other hand, alternative research techniques such as aerial surveys and genetic biopsy capture-recapture methods were designed and implemented. Reduced monitoring will constrain governments’ ability to assess sustainability of harvest especially if abundance is estimated from aerial surveys which cannot provide data on vital rates (Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009, Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Human caused habitat change and increasing human-bear interactions also must be incorporated into polar bear population projections (e.g., Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010) and polar bear harvest management in the future. Due to increased access to pre­viously isolated areas, Polar Bears will face increased risks from a variety of human–bear interactions. New settlements are possible with industrial development, and expansion of tourist visitations is assured. Although the fact of human–bear interactions can be reasonably measured, we have a long way to go to understand the effect of such interactions. The added stresses, resulting from a “more crowded” Arctic, may play an important role in the future welfare of Polar Bears."
